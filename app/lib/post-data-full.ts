        '\n<p>Combining classic noisy dirty fun of The Cramps and Butthole Surfers with video games like Diablo and Dark Souls plus some Lord of the Rings and Dungeons &amp; Dragons, Thee Khai Aehm\u2019s <em>Parrier </em>reappropriates the past while adding strictly modern nerdy flair.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The EP begins with guttural noises and faint Gregorian-style chanting of \u201cGrave Wraith\u201d before descending into A-grade garage-infused horror. It\u2019s where the aforementioned The Cramps influence becomes clear without ever sounding like a mere tribute.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cTribok Travelling\u201d is sheer fun with it\u2019s fast tempos, skeleton-dancing guitar and slightly off-key falsetto harmonies. Tribok is aka trebuchet.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio embed-youtube"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">\n<iframe loading="lazy" title="THEE KHAI AEHM - Tribok Travelling (official visualizer)" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/f9IeO4hLN84?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cImp\u201d is slow and sludgy with a wash of instruments only&nbsp; penetrated by a hypnotic tambourine. You\u2019d die in a mosh to this.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cWhole Once More\u201d slightly picks up the tempo while continuing the trance-like repetitiveness of its predecessor. The interplay of distant vocals could send chill down the spine if listened to alone in a dark alley (speaking from experience here).</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio embed-youtube"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">\n<iframe loading="lazy" title="THEE KHAI AEHM - Whole Once More (official visualizer)" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/t1ytIJI0Qh8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cEvens Up\u201d is 60s garage freakiness at its best. <a href="https://oddboll.net/home/premiere-thee-khai-aehm-evens-up">As we mentioned before</a>, this <em>is</em> the sound of summer.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>By the time \u201cThe Gathering at Mocking Tower\u201d starts, we\u2019re back to driving tempos. With chord progression referencing the very best of proto-punk you\u2019d be pressed not to nod along.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Parrier</em> is sheer noisy horror fun and one of the most true to its roots releases we\u2019ve heard recently.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<iframe style="border: 0; width: 100%; height: 120px;" src="https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=3549358310/size=large/bgcol=333333/linkcol=e99708/tracklist=false/artwork=small/transparent=true/" seamless><a href="https://theekhaiaehm.bandcamp.com/album/parrier">Parrier by THEE KHAI AEHM</a></iframe>\n',

        '\n<p>Ahead of the release of <a href="https://theekhaiaehm.bandcamp.com/album/parrier">Thee Khai Aehm\u2019s</a>&nbsp;<em>Parrier</em> EP this Saturday (save the date, yo), check out their new track \u201cEvens Up\u201d.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to Paul (y\u2019know, from the band), the tracks on <em>Parrier</em> were inspired by video games, movies and RPGs like Dark Souls, Diablo, DND and Lord of the Rings. <em>Tolkiencore</em>, anybody?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The evergreen garage progressions from the 60s hark back to the best of freakbeat as well as The Cramps. At the same time, the track packs a strictly modern punch. The chants in breakdowns are destined to be crowd-pleasers during shows.<br><br>Tasty overloaded guitars, sizzling cymbals, vocals drenched in oldschool echo \u2014 this <em>is</em> the sound of summer, iykwim.</p>\n\n\n\n<iframe style="border: 0; width: 100%; height: 120px;" src="https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=3549358310/size=large/bgcol=333333/linkcol=e99708/tracklist=false/artwork=small/track=395273389/transparent=true/" seamless><a href="https://theekhaiaehm.bandcamp.com/album/parrier">Parrier by THEE KHAI AEHM</a></iframe>\n',

But somehow punk is still not dead (yeah, we said it) and every decade manages to reimagine and repurpose the genre. And give us lots of exciting bands to listen to.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Otoboke Beaver are probably more punk than many \u201cclassic\u201d punk bands. Both musically and content-wise.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-full post-content-image" id="yui_3_17_2_1_1705075940782_80"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="760" height="507" src="http://localhost:8888/wordpress-trunk/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/otoboke-beaver-bad-luck-premiere.jpeg" alt="" class="wp-image-471" srcset="https://qfn.fuu.mybluehost.me/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/otoboke-beaver-bad-luck-premiere.jpeg 760w, https://qfn.fuu.mybluehost.me/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/otoboke-beaver-bad-luck-premiere-300x200.jpeg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 760px) 100vw, 760px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><em>Super Champions</em></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Musically, <em>Super Champon</em> takes the best from the last 50 years of punk rock and exaggerates it to cartoonish extremes. Breakneck tempos that change several times during the course of one track and sound like a stream of consciousness. 18 songs in 21 minutes. Several of them under 20 seconds. Riot grrrl themes. Fuck yeah!&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The bans called this album a \u201cmasterpiece of chaos music\u201d and we couldn\u2019t agree more.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Super Champon</em> is to be enjoyed in its entirety. Just be careful if you decide to bang your head to it.</p>\n\n\n\n<iframe style="border: 0; width: 100%; height: 120px;" src="https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=1933178362/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=de270f/tracklist=false/artwork=small/transparent=true/" seamless><a href="https://music.otobokebeaver.com/album/super-champon">SUPER CHAMPON \u30b9\u30fc\u30d1\u30fc\u30c1\u30e3\u30f3\u30dd\u30f3 by Otoboke Beaver \u304a\u3068\u307c\u3051\u30d3\uff5e\u30d0\uff5e</a></iframe>\n',

        '\n<p>We are people of contradictions and eclecticism here at oddboll and after treating you to a <a href="https://oddboll.net/home/barry-adamson-oedipus-shmoedipus">gorgeous soundtrack to the sleezy summer nights full of lynchian well-doers</a>, we are gonna treat you to a perfect soundtrack to summer <em>days</em>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Enter Rob.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And not just any Rob &#8211; funky, funky, funky Rob!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>From <a href="https://analogafrica.bandcamp.com/album/funky-rob-way-limited-dance-edition-nr-2">Bandcamp</a>:&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Rob Roy Reindorf &#8211; Born in Accra in 1947 &#8211; was an admirer of American artists Otis Reading, James Brown, Wilson Pickett and Ray Charles. He began his trade by learning the piano at a music school in Cotonou, Benin before playing with Orchestre Poly-Rythmo and the Black Santiago. After learning the science of music composition, Rob returned to Ghana where he began to write his own songs and eventually sought the backing of a band, specifically one that had horns. &nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In 1977 Rob travelled to the&nbsp;city of Takoradi in western Ghana to approach an army band named Mag-2 whom he had seen perform in Accra. Joining the army during the 1970s was often an easy decision for musicians since the army provided not only good music equipment but basic services such as food and medical care.&nbsp;Mag-2 was essentially filled with the best elements of &#8220;The Parrots,&#8221; a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Highlife">highlife</a> band.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Enticed by the innovative style of music Rob had proposed &#8211; a repertoire of cosmic, Afro-American funk-inspired progressive dancefloor sounds sung in English &#8211; Mag-2 backed on his first and second albums, <em>Funky Rob Way</em> and <em>Make it Fast, Make it Slow</em> both of which were recorded at Essiebons studios in Accra. They rehearsed for about one month with Rob providing cigarettes, food and drinks in place of hard cash.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And the legend was born.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-full post-content-image" id="yui_3_17_2_1_1705075614992_80"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="600" height="642" src="http://localhost:8888/wordpress-trunk/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/A-349836-1486407163-5976.jpeg" alt="" class="wp-image-462" srcset="https://qfn.fuu.mybluehost.me/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/A-349836-1486407163-5976.jpeg 600w, https://qfn.fuu.mybluehost.me/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/A-349836-1486407163-5976-280x300.jpeg 280w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The music makes you stomp your feet, bop your head, shake your rump and twist your knees from the very first bar. Most good funk music is like that but what makes Rob different is what he puts on top of those infectious rhythms. Psychy wah-wah guitars, spacey keys are occasionally pierced by JB\u2019s-esque horns and Rob\u2019s own \u201cfunky, funky, funky Rob!\u201d chanting.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The title track is followed by a cosmic slow burner of \u201cForgive Us All\u201d with its space-age wobbling keys and P-Funk style guitar solos. It speeds up towards the end blending into \u201cBoogie On\u201d, a repetitive gem perfect for making your dance floor dance.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cJust One More Time\u201d sounds like a 70s movie soundtrack but then again, the whole record has been described as such. Rob is a master of sonic storytelling and the music is very evocative throughout.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cYour Kiss Stole Me Away\u201d is a theme song from a space soap opera (Star Wars much?) that has never been made.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The album closer is \u201cMore\u201d and that\u2019s exactly what you should do with this record: listen to it more.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that\u2019s it. Like any perfect record, it is short and sweet prompting you to listen to it on repeat. It is mysterious, danceable, hypnotic, smart, meditative and just so good.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You don\u2019t need the sun or sand to enjoy \u201cRob\u201d. Put it on in January in Toronto and you\u2019ll be transported to the hot and sweaty dance floor on Venus. No wonder the original vinyl is super rare and is for sale rn for $7,740 Canadian on <a href="https://www.discogs.com/release/2467642-Rob-Rob">Discogs</a>. But if you want it on vinyl (and you should) there\u2019s an awesome <a href="https://analogafrica.bandcamp.com/album/funky-rob-way-limited-dance-edition-nr-2">Mr. Bongo/Analog Africa reissue</a> available.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Rob had recorded a third album, entitled <em>Hellfire</em> licensed by Nigerian label Tabansi, who lost the original recording only to find it when the style Rob had shaped his career around was in decline.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Making good money became a big problem, forcing the cosmic funk czar to travel to Germany and Sweden before returning to Accra to open his restaurant, the Chicken Pepper, where he can be found today.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-full post-content-image" id="yui_3_17_2_1_1705075614992_99"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="600" height="600" src="http://localhost:8888/wordpress-trunk/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/A-349836-1587532122-3297.jpeg" alt="" class="wp-image-463" srcset="https://qfn.fuu.mybluehost.me/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/A-349836-1587532122-3297.jpeg 600w, https://qfn.fuu.mybluehost.me/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/A-349836-1587532122-3297-300x300.jpeg 300w, https://qfn.fuu.mybluehost.me/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/A-349836-1587532122-3297-150x150.jpeg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><em>Possibly looking like this</em></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<div style="height:30px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>\n\n\n\n<iframe style="border: 0; width: 100%; height: 120px;" src="https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=3713703462/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=e99708/tracklist=false/artwork=small/transparent=true/" seamless><a href="https://mrbongo.bandcamp.com/album/rob-funky-rob-way">Rob (Funky Rob Way) by Rob</a></iframe>\n',

        '\n<p>What could be better to set a mood for a sticky sweaty summer night than a creepy af record from a Nick Cave collaborator and David Lynch soundtrackee (an artist who appeared on a soudtrack, look it up)? Especially when everybody outside is barely dressed and the record title alludes to a dude who killed his dad and fucked his momma (albeit unknowingly)? Yay, Barry Adamson!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The story goes smth like this: One day Barry Adamson got a call from David Lynch saying that he just listened to <em>Oedipus Shmoedipus</em> for 8 hours and it was like hearing Hitch\u2019s movies inside his had and that he needs this in his next movie. Pretty much sums it up, you can stop reading here.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-full post-content-image" id="yui_3_17_2_1_1705075456298_85"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="550" height="500" src="http://localhost:8888/wordpress-trunk/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/barry_1540814131.jpeg" alt="" class="wp-image-455" srcset="https://qfn.fuu.mybluehost.me/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/barry_1540814131.jpeg 550w, https://qfn.fuu.mybluehost.me/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/barry_1540814131-300x273.jpeg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 550px) 100vw, 550px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Howard Devoto</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The record opens with \u201cSet the Controls for the Heart of the Pelvis\u201d, a scene from an orgy sung with a sleazy kitschiness by Jarvis Cocker and the tension only keeps building up from there.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is followed by a masterpiece of acid jazz dark sex which is \u201cSomething Wicked This Way Comes\u201d. The latter was featured in the scene in <em>The Lost Highway </em>where we meet Mystery Man, the essence of a creep. Fun fact: the actor who played Mystery Man was tried for killing his wife a few years after the film\u2019s release and his story was incorporated in the character of Cliff Booth in Tarantino\u2019s <em>Once Upon A Time In Hollywood</em>. End of fun fact.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you\u2019re thinking \u201cthat\u2019s enough seedy bar soundtracks\u201d by this point you\u2019re wrong!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The very next &#8220;The Vibes Ain&#8217;t Nothin&#8217; but the Vibes\u201d is a nod to Lynch collaborator, Angelo Badalamenti with all the necessary cinematic gothiness included. The lyrics, describe \u201cHorny black boy with a frisky white girl\u201d who are \u201csecretly conspiring to murder each other\u201d only to \u201ccome together on a warm moonlit night In spite of themselves\u201d.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And after that dark but admittedly romantic moment (if you find <em>The Lost Highway </em>romantic, of course) comes the truly terrifying \u201cIt\u2019s Business As Usual\u201d with its atonal scary loop providing a backdrop for an answering machine recording of something reminiscent of a serial killer encounter.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Next is an upbeat jazzy tribute to \u201cMiles\u201d who? Could\u2019ve been an ad jingle, but it is not and I don\u2019t know why. Why, Barry?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cDirty Barry\u201d sounds like a nod to the <a href="https://oddboll.net/home/miles-davis-get-up-with-it"><em>Get Up With It</em></a>-era Miles and its title is more of a \u201cduh\u201d moment.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cIn a Moment of Clarity\u201d provides a sudden moment of tender jazzy clarity before diving into trip-hop tinted &#8220;Achieved in the Valley of Dolls\u201d. Scratching and beautiful vocals included.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cVermillion Kisses\u201d is an audiobook-style murder ballad. That could\u2019ve been a spoiler but c\u2019mon did you expect them to live happily ever after on <em>this</em> record?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;The Big Bamboozle\u201d sounds like an execution scene from an opera with a horn section to get drunk to.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cState of Contraction\u201d is a sombre piano number with emotive synth strings. Boring description, great track.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;The Sweetest Embrace\u201d features Nick Cave on vocals and sounds like some of the Cave\u2019s own output of the era although with less drunken alt blues and more with 50s noir vibe.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large post-content-image" id="yui_3_17_2_1_1705075456298_104"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="684" src="http://localhost:8888/wordpress-trunk/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/tumblr_67034051481dc3eb187c4240f3bdc648_e70af5f7_1280-1024x684.jpeg" alt="" class="wp-image-456" srcset="https://qfn.fuu.mybluehost.me/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/tumblr_67034051481dc3eb187c4240f3bdc648_e70af5f7_1280-1024x684.jpeg 1024w, https://qfn.fuu.mybluehost.me/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/tumblr_67034051481dc3eb187c4240f3bdc648_e70af5f7_1280-300x200.jpeg 300w, https://qfn.fuu.mybluehost.me/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/tumblr_67034051481dc3eb187c4240f3bdc648_e70af5f7_1280-768x513.jpeg 768w, https://qfn.fuu.mybluehost.me/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/tumblr_67034051481dc3eb187c4240f3bdc648_e70af5f7_1280.jpeg 1152w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><em>Shleft to shright: Shmarry Shmadamson, Shnick Shcave (Shave?), Shlixa Shargeld (aka Shblixa Shbargeld, if you\u2019re into overdoing things)</em></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The parade ends with &#8220;Set the Controls Again\u201d, a rocking swagger with wha-wha guitars and strings to match.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If this is not how you spend your summer nights you\u2019re living it WRONG.</p>\n\n\n\n<iframe style="border: 0; width: 100%; height: 120px;" src="https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=214615784/size=large/bgcol=333333/linkcol=e99708/tracklist=false/artwork=small/transparent=true/" seamless><a href="https://barryadamson.bandcamp.com/album/oedipus-schmoedipus">Oedipus Schmoedipus by Barry Adamson</a></iframe>\n',

        '\n<p>Music that is as hard to describe as it is challenging to listen to? In the 60s, such kind of music is what Cecil Taylor was pretty much up to. After a short stint with post-bop in the mid-50s, Taylor began gravitating towards more complex and exploratory music. <em>Nefertiti, The Beautiful One Has Come </em>is the line between before and after.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In 1962 Taylor went to Europe with alto saxophonist&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jimmy_Lyons">Jimmy Lyons</a>&nbsp;and drummer&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunny_Murray">Sunny Murray</a>, one the first \u201cfree\u201d drummers. According to Murray, around this time the band made a stylistic breakthrough: &#8220;We were in Sweden and we had finally decided to be free&#8230; The way Cecil and Jimmy and I were playing, we could absorb any different thing at that period, because we were so fresh!\u201d <em>Nefertiti, The Beautiful One Has Come </em>being the only album from Cecil Taylor in 1962-65 is a document of that transformation.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-full post-content-image" id="yui_3_17_2_1_1705075267028_76"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1300" height="1300" src="http://localhost:8888/wordpress-trunk/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1-cecil-taylor.gif" alt="" class="wp-image-449"/><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><em>Cecil Taylor contemplates disrupting traditions</em></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The album was recorded live at the&nbsp;Caf\u00e9 Montmartre&nbsp;in&nbsp;Copenhagen, Denmark on November 23, 1962. Part of the concert was released on the album&nbsp;<em>Live at the Caf\u00e9 Montmartre</em>&nbsp;with more following on&nbsp;<em>Nefertiti, the Beautiful One Has Come</em>. The material was also issued as&nbsp;<em>Trance</em>,&nbsp;<em>Innovations</em>, and&nbsp;<em>What&#8217;s New</em>. For the most complete experience, you gotta listen to all of them. At almost 2 hours of music it might be challenging but 100% rewarding. The music is dense but the musicians\u2019 freedom is truly inspiring.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Unlike many later advances in free jazz, <em>Nefertiti\u2026</em> retains relative \u201clistenability\u201d and could be a good entry point into the messy and chaotic world of free jazz. The instruments are still one unit, the rhythms are connected to the melodies and if they are not in the same key they are still working as a Unit (<em>Cecil Taylor Jazz Unit</em>, to be precise).&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-full post-content-image" id="yui_3_17_2_1_1705075267028_95"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="600" height="600" src="http://localhost:8888/wordpress-trunk/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/CecilTaylor_sq.jpeg" alt="" class="wp-image-450" srcset="https://qfn.fuu.mybluehost.me/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/CecilTaylor_sq.jpeg 600w, https://qfn.fuu.mybluehost.me/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/CecilTaylor_sq-300x300.jpeg 300w, https://qfn.fuu.mybluehost.me/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/CecilTaylor_sq-150x150.jpeg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><em>Cecil Taylor disrupts traditions</em></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Legend has it, that &#8220;D Trad, That&#8217;s What\u201d, a stunning side-long barrage of notes, was inspired by seeing John Coltrane play the night before.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The new version of \u201cLena\u201d, twice as long as the original, sees everybody building and building culminating in the astonishing latter 7-minutes of the track that, unfortunately, fade out (mb tape ran out).&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cWhat\u2019s New\u201d is an atypical for later period Taylor jazz standard and the only track here not composed by him. Jimmy Lions shows off his roots here while channelling his inner Charlie Parker.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Best summed up by Mike Trouchon in his review: \u201cWith as much frenetic energy as this music exudes, it also possesses a certain lyricism and abstract tranquillity (cf. \u2018Call\u2019). Moving beyond the musical holism embraced by Ellington, Monk, and Tristano, Cecil Taylor saw (and still does see) music as existing on meta-scales far beyond the individual notes and chords of which it is comprised.\u201d Word.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-spotify wp-block-embed-spotify wp-embed-aspect-21-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">\n<iframe title="Spotify Embed: Nefertiti, The Beautiful One Has Come - Live At The Cafe Montmartre, 1962" style="border-radius: 12px" width="100%" height="352" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen allow="autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture" loading="lazy" src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/album/165RoaYmMQpxFzBXZZexvI?utm_source=oembed"></iframe>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<iframe allow="autoplay *; encrypted-media *; fullscreen *; clipboard-write" frameborder="0" height="450" style="width:100%;max-width:660px;overflow:hidden;border-radius:10px;" sandbox="allow-forms allow-popups allow-same-origin allow-scripts allow-storage-access-by-user-activation allow-top-navigation-by-user-activation" src="https://embed.music.apple.com/us/album/nefertiti-the-beautiful-one-has-come/549208178"></iframe>\n',

        '\n<p>Compilations usually get shit (from me) for rarely being more than a money grab for labels to capitalize on artists\u2019 success (looking at you <em>Radiohead:</em> <em>The Best Of</em>).&nbsp;However, it still works for the artists that don\u2019t have much in terms of deep cuts or if their discography is so vast and diverse that you need a place to start.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Enter <em>EPs 1992-2002</em>, a compilation of all 11 extended plays for guess which period?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What is immediately telling of Autechre\u2019s output is the length of this compilation. With 5.5 hours of music, it could be quite tedious for just an \u201centry point\u201d and that is what makes this box set so cool: it\u2019s great for both hyperfans and newbies. And the length shouldn\u2019t surprise you since this Autechre we\u2019re talking about and they have an 8-hour long album ffs.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-full post-content-image" id="yui_3_17_2_1_1705013073352_75"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="600" height="600" src="http://localhost:8888/wordpress-trunk/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/cavity-job.jpeg" alt="" class="wp-image-433" srcset="https://qfn.fuu.mybluehost.me/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/cavity-job.jpeg 600w, https://qfn.fuu.mybluehost.me/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/cavity-job-300x300.jpeg 300w, https://qfn.fuu.mybluehost.me/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/cavity-job-150x150.jpeg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The compilation begins with <em>Cavity Job</em>, their debut EP and their first release as Autechre. It brings back memories of simpler times when you still could kinda figure out how they create all the sounds and also nod your head to the rhythm in 4/4 and not in 13/<em>\ud835\udefd&gt;\u22121;0\u2264\ud835\udefc&lt;1.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large post-content-image" id="yui_3_17_2_1_1705013073352_94"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="1024" src="http://localhost:8888/wordpress-trunk/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/basscad-1024x1024.jpeg" alt="" class="wp-image-434" srcset="https://qfn.fuu.mybluehost.me/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/basscad-1024x1024.jpeg 1024w, https://qfn.fuu.mybluehost.me/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/basscad-300x300.jpeg 300w, https://qfn.fuu.mybluehost.me/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/basscad-150x150.jpeg 150w, https://qfn.fuu.mybluehost.me/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/basscad-768x768.jpeg 768w, https://qfn.fuu.mybluehost.me/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/basscad.jpeg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>After <em>Cavity Job </em>comes <em>Basscad </em>which marked the beginning of Autechre\u2019s gradual transition from their techno and hip hop roots. The rhythms are still noddable but the atmosphere starts to grow weirder. Still sounds fresh almost 30 years on.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large post-content-image" id="yui_3_17_2_1_1705013073352_103"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="1024" src="http://localhost:8888/wordpress-trunk/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/anti-1024x1024.jpeg" alt="" class="wp-image-435" srcset="https://qfn.fuu.mybluehost.me/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/anti-1024x1024.jpeg 1024w, https://qfn.fuu.mybluehost.me/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/anti-300x300.jpeg 300w, https://qfn.fuu.mybluehost.me/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/anti-150x150.jpeg 150w, https://qfn.fuu.mybluehost.me/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/anti-768x768.jpeg 768w, https://qfn.fuu.mybluehost.me/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/anti.jpeg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Their third EP, <em>Anti</em>, is a protest EP released in the wake of the UK\u2019s dumb <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criminal_Justice_and_Public_Order_Act_1994">Criminal Justice and Public Order Act of 1994</a>, which would prohibit raves (described as gatherings where music is played), with &#8220;music&#8221; being defined as a &#8220;succession of repetitive beats.\u201d Sean Booth explained the band&#8217;s strategy for the song &#8220;Flutter&#8221; by saying, &#8220;We made as many different bars as we could on the drum machine, then strung them all together.\u201d<br>The packaging bore a sticker with a disclaimer about the repetitive nature of the rhythmic elements of &#8220;Lost&#8221; and &#8220;Djarum&#8221;.&nbsp;&#8220;Flutter&#8221; was programmed to have non-repetitive beats and therefore &#8220;can be played at both forty five and thirty three&nbsp;revolutions&nbsp;under the proposed law&#8221;; but following their disclaimer, it was advised that DJs &#8220;have a lawyer and a musicologist present at all times to confirm the non repetitive nature of the music in the event of police harassment.&#8221;&nbsp;The sticker acted as a seal, which was required to be broken in order to access the media enclosed in the packaging.<br>The profits from this release went to the political pressure group&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberty_(advocacy_group)">Liberty</a>. The sticker ended with this last statement: &#8220;Autechre is politically non-aligned. This is about personal freedom.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-full post-content-image" id="yui_3_17_2_1_1705013073352_112"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="700" height="700" src="http://localhost:8888/wordpress-trunk/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/garbage.jpeg" alt="" class="wp-image-436" srcset="https://qfn.fuu.mybluehost.me/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/garbage.jpeg 700w, https://qfn.fuu.mybluehost.me/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/garbage-300x300.jpeg 300w, https://qfn.fuu.mybluehost.me/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/garbage-150x150.jpeg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Coming up next we\u2019ve got <em>Garbage</em>, a 1995 companion EP to <em>Amber</em> based on material from the same sessions. The cover is a digitally fucked up image of the <em>Amber</em> cover. On the EP (but not on&nbsp;this comp) the tracks are written as &#8220;Garbagemx36&#8243;/&#8221;PIOBmx19&#8243;/&#8221;Bronchusevenmx24&#8243;/&#8221;VLetrmx21&#8221;. The numbers at the end of the track titles are the percentage of the total EP time each track takes up, with the total being 100.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large post-content-image" id="yui_3_17_2_1_1705013073352_121"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="1024" src="http://localhost:8888/wordpress-trunk/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/anvil-vapre-1024x1024.jpeg" alt="" class="wp-image-437" srcset="https://qfn.fuu.mybluehost.me/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/anvil-vapre-1024x1024.jpeg 1024w, https://qfn.fuu.mybluehost.me/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/anvil-vapre-300x300.jpeg 300w, https://qfn.fuu.mybluehost.me/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/anvil-vapre-150x150.jpeg 150w, https://qfn.fuu.mybluehost.me/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/anvil-vapre-768x768.jpeg 768w, https://qfn.fuu.mybluehost.me/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/anvil-vapre.jpeg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Anvil Vapre</em>, Autechre\u2019s fourth EP was originally released as a companion to <em>Tri Repetae</em>. The tracks from this EP were omitted from the album due to space constraints. The song names are inspired by scenery associated with&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snake_Pass">Snake Pass</a>;&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bad_Vilbel">Bad Vilbel</a>&nbsp;is a German spa town that is twinned with&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glossop">Glossop</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-full post-content-image" id="yui_3_17_2_1_1705013073352_130"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="970" height="970" src="http://localhost:8888/wordpress-trunk/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/peel-session.jpeg" alt="" class="wp-image-438" srcset="https://qfn.fuu.mybluehost.me/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/peel-session.jpeg 970w, https://qfn.fuu.mybluehost.me/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/peel-session-300x300.jpeg 300w, https://qfn.fuu.mybluehost.me/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/peel-session-150x150.jpeg 150w, https://qfn.fuu.mybluehost.me/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/peel-session-768x768.jpeg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 970px) 100vw, 970px" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Disc 3 (if you were counting) kicks off with <em>Peel Session</em>. Released in 1999 it contains material recorded for Radio 1 in 1995. \u201dDrane&#8221; was later selected by Warp Records co-founder Steve Beckett as one of his 14 absolute favourite tracks from the Warp catalogue for the&nbsp;Warp20 (Chosen)&nbsp;compilation.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large post-content-image" id="yui_3_17_2_1_1705013073352_139"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="1024" src="http://localhost:8888/wordpress-trunk/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/envane-1024x1024.jpeg" alt="" class="wp-image-439" srcset="https://qfn.fuu.mybluehost.me/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/envane-1024x1024.jpeg 1024w, https://qfn.fuu.mybluehost.me/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/envane-300x300.jpeg 300w, https://qfn.fuu.mybluehost.me/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/envane-150x150.jpeg 150w, https://qfn.fuu.mybluehost.me/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/envane-768x768.jpeg 768w, https://qfn.fuu.mybluehost.me/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/envane.jpeg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Concluding Disc 3 is <em>Envane</em>, their fifth EP. The cover art is an&nbsp;abstraction&nbsp;of a photograph of&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fallingwater">Fallingwater</a>, a&nbsp;modern&nbsp;house designed by American architect&nbsp;Frank Lloyd Wright.<br>The opening track &#8220;Goz Quarter&#8221; contains both&nbsp;scratching&nbsp;and a vocal sample taken from &#8220;No Awareness&#8221; on&nbsp;Dr. Octagonecologyst but you didn\u2019t hear it from us.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large post-content-image" id="yui_3_17_2_1_1705013073352_148"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="1024" src="http://localhost:8888/wordpress-trunk/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/cichlisuite-1024x1024.jpeg" alt="" class="wp-image-440" srcset="https://qfn.fuu.mybluehost.me/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/cichlisuite-1024x1024.jpeg 1024w, https://qfn.fuu.mybluehost.me/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/cichlisuite-300x300.jpeg 300w, https://qfn.fuu.mybluehost.me/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/cichlisuite-150x150.jpeg 150w, https://qfn.fuu.mybluehost.me/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/cichlisuite-768x768.jpeg 768w, https://qfn.fuu.mybluehost.me/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/cichlisuite.jpeg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Cichlisuite</em>, as the title suggests, is supposed to contain remixes of \u201cCichli\u201d from <em>Chiastic Slide</em> but none of the tracks sound similar to it.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large post-content-image" id="yui_3_17_2_1_1705013073352_157"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="1024" src="http://localhost:8888/wordpress-trunk/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/ep7-1024x1024.jpeg" alt="" class="wp-image-441" srcset="https://qfn.fuu.mybluehost.me/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/ep7-1024x1024.jpeg 1024w, https://qfn.fuu.mybluehost.me/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/ep7-300x300.jpeg 300w, https://qfn.fuu.mybluehost.me/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/ep7-150x150.jpeg 150w, https://qfn.fuu.mybluehost.me/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/ep7-768x768.jpeg 768w, https://qfn.fuu.mybluehost.me/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/ep7.jpeg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>It\u2019s kind of a mystery why <em>EP7</em> is classified as an EP considering its 70 min length. Because of its title, Autechre\u2019s untitled fifth album began to be called <em>LP5</em>. The&nbsp;fractal&nbsp;on the cover was designed with a circuit board designer. The minisite created by Warp also featured a fractal generator that would create new artwork similar to that featured throughout the liner notes. The original UK CD pressing includes a&nbsp;hidden track&nbsp;in the&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pregap">pregap</a>. The track can be accessed by rewinding from the beginning of \u201cRpeg\u201d.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Two more.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-full post-content-image" id="yui_3_17_2_1_1705013073352_166"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="500" height="492" src="http://localhost:8888/wordpress-trunk/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/peel-session-2.jpeg" alt="" class="wp-image-442" srcset="https://qfn.fuu.mybluehost.me/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/peel-session-2.jpeg 500w, https://qfn.fuu.mybluehost.me/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/peel-session-2-300x295.jpeg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Peel Session 2</em> was recorded in 1999. The tracks were given to John Peel unnamed and he himself named them.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large post-content-image" id="yui_3_17_2_1_1705013073352_175"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="1024" src="http://localhost:8888/wordpress-trunk/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/gantz-graf-1024x1024.jpeg" alt="" class="wp-image-443" srcset="https://qfn.fuu.mybluehost.me/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/gantz-graf-1024x1024.jpeg 1024w, https://qfn.fuu.mybluehost.me/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/gantz-graf-300x300.jpeg 300w, https://qfn.fuu.mybluehost.me/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/gantz-graf-150x150.jpeg 150w, https://qfn.fuu.mybluehost.me/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/gantz-graf-768x768.jpeg 768w, https://qfn.fuu.mybluehost.me/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/gantz-graf.jpeg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Concluding the comp is <em>Gantz Graf. </em>The release came with an additional 5&#8243; DVD disc with music videos.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Listening to this compilation in one go shows how much Autechre changed in a decade. From working within actual genres they ended up being not just a genre but a whole movement of its own, unparalleled by anyone.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The packaging for <em>EPs 1992-2002 </em>contains no liner notes or a detailed tracklist. In their interview, Autechre showed disdain for album art, track titles or pretty much anything besides the music itself. And their music is probably the most beautiful alien music out there.</p>\n\n\n\n<iframe style="border: 0; width: 100%; height: 120px;" src="https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=548009296/size=large/bgcol=333333/linkcol=ffffff/tracklist=false/artwork=small/transparent=true/" seamless><a href="https://autechre.bandcamp.com/album/eps-1991-2002">EPs 1991 &#8211; 2002 by Autechre</a></iframe>\n',

        '\n<p><em>Inverted</em>, the sophomore full-length from Toronto-based four-piece arrived at an unfortunate time at the beginning of sweeping lockdowns around the globe. Now, with everything slowly coming back, we had a chance to chat with the band ahead of their <a href="https://www.wavelengthmusic.ca/wavelength-presents-marker-starling-nina-savary/">November 20 show</a> and indulge in their incredible music. <a href="https://oddboll.net/home/animatist-interview">Check out our interview here</a>.\u00a0</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio embed-youtube"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">\n<iframe loading="lazy" title="INVERTED Blip 6" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/EG7PQEUCVbU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>From the soft opening plucks of \u201cWhere\u2019s My Dopamine?\u201d to angular overdriven mayhem of \u201cIhavecompletedmyfamily\u201d, <em>Inverted </em>keeps you on the edge of your chair. The music is smart, unpredictable without ever being brainy or self-indulgent. It\u2019s a fine line to walk but Animatist manage it with seemingly effortless mastery. The rhythm section is tight, precise and to the point. Ian Hinds\u2019 drumming is busy but never overpowering with lots of tasteful blink-and-you-miss-it <em>micro</em>hits (let\u2019s pretend it\u2019s a word).</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large post-content-image" id="yui_3_17_2_1_1705012289040_81"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="695" src="http://localhost:8888/wordpress-trunk/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/AnimatistPhoto3-1024x695.jpeg" alt="" class="wp-image-402" srcset="https://qfn.fuu.mybluehost.me/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/AnimatistPhoto3-1024x695.jpeg 1024w, https://qfn.fuu.mybluehost.me/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/AnimatistPhoto3-300x204.jpeg 300w, https://qfn.fuu.mybluehost.me/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/AnimatistPhoto3-768x521.jpeg 768w, https://qfn.fuu.mybluehost.me/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/AnimatistPhoto3-1536x1043.jpeg 1536w, https://qfn.fuu.mybluehost.me/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/AnimatistPhoto3.jpeg 1964w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><em>Y\u2019know, the gang</em></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Steve Cook\u2019s 6-string bass is deep, warm and visceral providing as much of a melody and bottom end as keeping the rhythms (or rather <em>poly</em>rhythms) firmly in the odd territory.<br>These rhythms are further augmented by Brent O\u2019Toole\u2019s truly diverse guitar. From being one with bass and drums to shimmering textures to instances of overdriven frenzy it adds a colourful ornament to all the breakbeats.<br>The final piece of the puzzle is Danielle Fernandes\u2019 impeccable sax and eery synth textures.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Further adding to the display of musical proficiency is the fact that <em>Inverted</em> was recorded live almost entirely. According to Cook, \u201cWeird Digits\u201d was recorded in one take.\u00a0</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio embed-youtube"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">\n<iframe loading="lazy" title="Animatist Live from the Basement" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/pyJOkAYlVuQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The record\u2019s true power lies in its masterfully executed dynamics. From soft jazzy chill to noisy no-wave leaning explosions, Animatist sound like they know exactly what they\u2019re doing. It\u2019s a true achievement for a band who\u2019s music exists in a territory many musicians never even dare to explore.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To paraphrase Danielle\u2019s quote from our interview: just listen to the music. It says it all.</p>\n\n\n\n<iframe style="border: 0; width: 100%; height: 120px;" src="https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=2660604084/size=large/bgcol=333333/linkcol=e32c14/tracklist=false/artwork=small/transparent=true/" seamless><a href="https://animatist.bandcamp.com/album/inverted">INVERTED by Animatist</a></iframe>\n',

        '\n<p>We meet at Danielle and Brent\u2019s place. The lights are dimmed. <a href="https://menitrust.bandcamp.com/"><strong>Men I Trust</strong></a> is playing on low volume. There\u2019s Moog Mother-32 chilling on the desk. Turns out we all went to see GWAR with Napalm Death a couple days prior.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>What exactly is Animatist and how did you guys start?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Ian Hinds: </strong>Brent and I went to high school together. I played in another band and we recorded at Brent\u2019s house. He showed me some of his stuff. I instantly dug it, we jammed and shit just clicked.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Brent O\u2019Toole:</strong> Ian and I both looked like goofballs at school. Ian had dreadlocks and looked like a stoner, I was trying my hardest to look like John Lennon. We used to call each other stupid nicknames in the hallway. Ian\u2019s was Shroomy and I was Lenny for John Lennon.<br>I was recording the band Ian mentioned and asked him to play the whole kit. He played <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z26eM4Gr0cA"><strong>\u201cRoulette Dares\u201d</strong></a> by Mars Volta (whom I was into at the time) and ripped it perfectly!<br>It kinda built up after that. I went to Guelph University and met Danielle. Then it became a three-piece. At our second show, Steve walked up to me and said \u201cI\u2019m your new bassist\u201d.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Steve Cook: </strong>I remember you were paying at Rancho. At the time I was really getting into <a href="https://jagajazzist.bandcamp.com/"><strong>Jaga Jazzist</strong></a> and what you guys played gave me Jaga Jazzist vibes so I was like \u201cI wanna be in this\u201d.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large post-content-image" id="yui_3_17_2_1_1705012134959_72"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="683" src="http://localhost:8888/wordpress-trunk/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/AnimatistPhoto2-1024x683.jpeg" alt="" class="wp-image-394" srcset="https://qfn.fuu.mybluehost.me/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/AnimatistPhoto2-1024x683.jpeg 1024w, https://qfn.fuu.mybluehost.me/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/AnimatistPhoto2-300x200.jpeg 300w, https://qfn.fuu.mybluehost.me/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/AnimatistPhoto2-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://qfn.fuu.mybluehost.me/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/AnimatistPhoto2-1536x1024.jpeg 1536w, https://qfn.fuu.mybluehost.me/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/AnimatistPhoto2.jpeg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><em>Attack mode</em></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Would you consider the transformation that happened between </strong><a href="https://animatist.bandcamp.com/album/seeds-ep"><strong><em>Seeds EP</em></strong></a><strong> (2009) and </strong><a href="https://animatist.bandcamp.com/album/face-club"><strong><em>Face Club</em></strong></a><strong> (2017) a conscious effort or more of a natural progression?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Brent:</strong> Seeds EP was just us trying to capture what we were into at the time. Then I went to University of Guelph to study guitar. At that school there was a lot of emphasis on free jazz, fully freeform music, noise music. So, trying to make songs like Radiohead turned into this distorted version of that original idea. Also in Guelph there were a lot of sick bands so you were always trying to be better and weirder and noisier.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Danielle Fernandes:</strong> Yeah, I don\u2019t think we were going for a particular sound. We don\u2019t necessarily have the end product in mind.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Steve: </strong>Sorta like iterative refining. There\u2019s no grand plan. Even though it sounds like it was planned because we\u2019re trying to make it sound organic.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>What are your musical backgrounds?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Ian: </strong>I started playing age 11 with a teacher. I remember the teacher was showing me <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2MRdtXWcgIw"><strong>\u201cAdam\u2019s Song\u201d</strong></a> by Blink-182 and I picked it up fast. And that was it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Steve:</strong> I had this older cousin who was showing me cool music and he was obsessed with Flea. This was the first time I really started paying attention to bass. I was really lucky because everyone wanted a bass player. I was in a band with Brent\u2019s cousin, Shane. That\u2019s how I met Brent.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Danielle: </strong>My dad is a musician and I learned a lot from him. I started when I was 6. I did classical guitar and a bit of piano through childhood. When I was 12 I had to choose a band instrument so I chose the saxophone. At the university I did classical saxophone. That\u2019s where I met Brent and we started making free improvised music. I never thought I would be in a rock band because I played sax.<br><strong>Steve: </strong>I think you play it like punk sax.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Ian:<em> </em></strong>One thing worth mentioning is that we have uncannily similar tastes in music.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Do you feel it is beneficial to your music?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Brent: </strong>Some of our favorite bands are lesser known and not that many people sound like them. For example we all like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zazen_Boys"><strong>Zazen Boys</strong></a> and I think when all of us like a band that sounds so different it brings us in a direction to make our music similarly unique.\u00a0</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio embed-youtube"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">\n<iframe loading="lazy" title="INVERTED Blip 7" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5lmIvEaz4N8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>How much does gear affect your music? Do you think it\u2019d be the same with a frying pan and a pair of spoons?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Danielle:</strong> I am the synth person but I\u2019ve never played it before this band. If we were to replace it with a frying pan I\u2019d be so happy because I hate gear.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Steve:</strong> I use a 6-string bass in weird tunings. If I had to use someone else\u2019s bass, even if it had the right number of strings I\u2019m in trouble because the strings might just snap.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Brent:</strong> I don\u2019t really like guitar. I\u2019m good at navigating it and it feels the easiest for me but I don\u2019t like a lot of things that guitar does. So I started amassing a bunch of pedals. I think we\u2019ve gotten really used to the way we create sounds so if you take out any part of it we\u2019d be making completely different music. It would still be jazzy, math-rocky, weird time signatures but texturally it would be different. But I don\u2019t think gear makes it what it is.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Steve:</strong> I think it does.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Brent:</strong> Shit, I gotta think about it now.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>How did your approach change between <em>Face Club</em> and <em>Inverted?</em></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Brent: </strong><em>Face Club </em>was recorded in my parents\u2019 basement. We engineered it ourselves. We had to do it track by track because there wasn\u2019t enough room for everybody. My main goal for <em>Inverted</em> was to bring that live energy to it. It helped a lot with really honing the tracks and not thinking that we can fix the mistakes later.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Danielle:</strong> Recording <em>Face Club,</em> we just couldn\u2019t get it to sound the way we wanted to. I had to re-record my parts over and over. And then a week later we\u2019d have to do it again. On <em>Inverted</em> we learned how to do it better.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Steve:</strong> I\u2019m pretty sure \u201cWeird Digits\u201d is the first take recorded off the floor.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>How did you spend the lockdown?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Ian: </strong>Smoking copious amounts of weed. A lot of gaming.&nbsp; A lot of self-loathing. It was tough. I\u2019m sure there are people who stayed productive but I was just out of it. I found it really hard to ease back into it. For the first couple of months it was like \u201cwhat the F?\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Brent:</strong> we had one session for two or three days to put a thing together for <a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/318050822921796/?ref=newsfeed"><strong>Lingua Franca Festival</strong></a> and then fucked off for another year.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Danielle: </strong>We hardly ever cancel practice. We met every week for five years. Lockdown was a huge disappointment. We had <em>Inverted</em> ready to go, ordered vinyl. Had shows lined up at the end of May 2020.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Brent:</strong> I run a label, <a href="https://gluegunrecords.bandcamp.com/"><strong>Glue Gun Records</strong></a> and didn\u2019t know a lot of things a label should be doing. I focused on that during the lockdown, trying to help other people release their music. It worked out and I think that\u2019s why we decided to put out <em>Inverted</em> on Glue Gun. That\u2019s one good thing.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large post-content-image" id="yui_3_17_2_1_1705012134959_91"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="684" src="http://localhost:8888/wordpress-trunk/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/AnimatistPhoto5-1024x684.jpeg" alt="" class="wp-image-396" srcset="https://qfn.fuu.mybluehost.me/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/AnimatistPhoto5-1024x684.jpeg 1024w, https://qfn.fuu.mybluehost.me/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/AnimatistPhoto5-300x200.jpeg 300w, https://qfn.fuu.mybluehost.me/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/AnimatistPhoto5-768x513.jpeg 768w, https://qfn.fuu.mybluehost.me/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/AnimatistPhoto5-1536x1025.jpeg 1536w, https://qfn.fuu.mybluehost.me/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/AnimatistPhoto5.jpeg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>How does it feel doing live shows again?</strong> <strong>Do you feel like something changed?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Danielle:</strong> God, it was like riding a bicycle. At our first rehearsal back we played and it was pretty good. Turned out we still got it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Steve:</strong> We\u2019ve always been really harsh on ourselves.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Ian:</strong> It\u2019s a double-edged sword.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Brent:</strong> Makes us super-tight.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Ian: </strong>That\u2019s the thing, it\u2019s gotta be.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Steve: </strong>We care.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Brent:</strong> Our first show back was an outdoor show at <a href="https://www.dromtaberna.com/"><strong>Drom Taberna</strong></a>. Most people were sitting down not wearing masks and for a moment it felt like the pandemic wasn\u2019t going on. &nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>What does the future look like for Animatist?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Brent:</strong> We have a <a href="https://www.wavelengthmusic.ca/wavelength-presents-marker-starling-nina-savary/"><strong>show coming up on November 20</strong></a>. The main mission is to get back to playing live. And then we\u2019ll try and write some songs that are a little different. When the festival season comes up in summer we\u2019re hoping to get on a few things.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>There\u2019s not much info about you online (yet) what would you like people to know?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Danielle:</strong> Just come to our show. All that \u201cwhere you\u2019re coming from?\u201d is just fluff. Come to the show, the music it says it all.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Brent:</strong> Yeah, we\u2019re sick live! Come see us live.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Ian:</strong> I think we can solve world peace with our music.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>This interview was commissioned by and first appeared on </em><a href="https://www.wavelengthmusic.ca/community/wavelog/"><em>wavelengthmusic.ca</em></a><em></em></p>\n',

        '\n<p>During his long career, Miles Davis made so many iconic and landmark records that it\u2019s very easy to overlook multiple gems in his vast discography. As Miles put it himself: \u201cI\u2019ve changed music five or six times.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In 1968 Davis married <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Betty_Davis">Betty Mabry</a> who later transformed herself into Betty Davis, one of the most defiant female voices in 70s funk. Although their marriage folded in about a year, Mabry influenced Davis greatly by introducing him to popular rock, soul and funk musicians. Jazz critic&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leonard_Feather">Leonard Feather</a>&nbsp;visited Davis&#8217; apartment and was shocked to find him listening to albums by&nbsp;The Byrds,&nbsp;Aretha Franklin, and&nbsp;Dionne Warwick. He also liked&nbsp;James Brown,&nbsp;Sly and the Family Stone, and&nbsp;Jimi Hendrix, whose&nbsp;Band of Gypsys&nbsp;particularly made an impression on Davis.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This led to the so called \u201cElectric Period\u201d which among others birthed some of the finest records Miles Davis ever produced including <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_a_Silent_Way"><em>In a Silent Way</em></a><em> </em>(1969),<em> </em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitches_Brew"><em>Bitches Brew</em></a><em> </em>(1970) and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On_the_Corner"><em>On the Corner&nbsp;</em></a>(1972).&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Around that time his health was failing and <em>Get Up With It</em> would be his last studio album before a 5-year hiatus.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-full post-content-image" id="yui_3_17_2_1_1705011966968_81"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="800" height="742" src="http://localhost:8888/wordpress-trunk/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/caf7dd-20130301-miles-davis.jpeg" alt="" class="wp-image-391" srcset="https://qfn.fuu.mybluehost.me/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/caf7dd-20130301-miles-davis.jpeg 800w, https://qfn.fuu.mybluehost.me/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/caf7dd-20130301-miles-davis-300x278.jpeg 300w, https://qfn.fuu.mybluehost.me/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/caf7dd-20130301-miles-davis-768x712.jpeg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><em>70s Miles Davis is very 70s</em></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Technically, it\u2019s not even a proper album but rather a compilation of various studio sessions including those for the studio albums&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Johnson_(album)"><em>Jack Johnson</em></a>&nbsp;(1971) and&nbsp;<em>On the Corner</em>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;He Loved Him Madly&#8221; was recorded by Davis as his tribute to then-recently deceased&nbsp;Duke Ellington, who used to tell his audiences &#8220;I love you madly.\u201d British musician&nbsp;Brian Eno&nbsp;cited it as an influence on his work in&nbsp;ambient music&nbsp;in the liner notes to his 1982 release&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On_Land"><em>On Land</em></a>. Davis is using various effects to process his trumpet including a wah-wah.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It\u2019s been noted that <em>Get Up With It</em> is more difficult to write about than his other albums and rightfully so. The album is 2 hours long and is more about texture than individual instruments and solos. Writing about it in 2021 shows just how influential this work proved to be. \u201cHe Loved Him Madly\u201d sounds at times as if produced by Massive Attack in the mid-90s. The rhythm section and the abstract ambient-y solos could\u2019ve been in a \u201cBeats For Studying\u201d playlist were they not so unsettling at times. \u201cMaiysha\u201d moves away from the hypnotic quietness of \u201cHe Loved Him Madly\u201d to sizzling cymbals and a more funk-based rhythm section. \u201cHony Tonk\u201d is a much heavier, blues-rock workout with some glorious polyrhythms. Ending the first half of the album is \u201cRated X\u201d with its shrieking organs and busy percussion-heavy rhythms.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-4-3 wp-has-aspect-ratio embed-youtube"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">\n<iframe loading="lazy" title="Miles Davis - Funk...Calypso Frelimo" width="500" height="375" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/BjiusdXr_O0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The second part is a bit less abstract and experimental leaning towards worldbeat and fusion with strong funk influences. \u201cCalypso Frelimo\u201d, another 32-minute epic kicks off with sample-worthy drum and bass that eventually breaks down into a meditative downtempo only to pick up the pace later on and enter a trumpet frenzy towards the end of the track.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is worth mentioning the stellar cast of musicians which is something one might expect from a Miles Davis effort. &nbsp;<a href="https://pitchfork.com/artists/12521-herbie-hancock/">Herbie Hancock</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://pitchfork.com/artists/15745-keith-jarrett/">Keith Jarrett</a>, Billy Cobham, Al Foster, Airto, John McLaughlin, Reggie Lucas, Pete Cosey, James Mtume, David Liebman all make appearances on the record with bass guitar duties taken over by Michael Henderson, a touring member of Stevie Wonder\u2019s band and only 19 when the first sessions that appear on this record took place.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>During his electric period, Davis also started to move away from playing the trumpet which is also evident on <em>Get Up With It</em>. Most tracks barely feature his main instrument and he often plays electric organ. His keyboard playing may have lacked finesse of his trumpet but the sounds he produces where otherworldly drones and blasts of atonal noise.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Unfortunately, during this time Miles Davis was increasingly sinking into his own darkness. \u201cMusic is a curse\u201d he proclaimed. He ended up disappearing for seven years. When he returned, his music was never the same. <em>Get Up With It </em>might be the last truly groundbreaking Miles Davis record. But even if it is, with its influence spanning over jazz, ambient, no wave and even punk, it\u2019s an essential listen.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-spotify wp-block-embed-spotify wp-embed-aspect-21-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">\n<iframe title="Spotify Embed: Get Up With It" style="border-radius: 12px" width="100%" height="352" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen allow="autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture" loading="lazy" src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/album/0CFS3jvFwutIt5ewGIa7Sq?si=df10465be96d49f1&#038;utm_source=oembed"></iframe>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<iframe allow="autoplay *; encrypted-media *; fullscreen *; clipboard-write" frameborder="0" height="450" style="width:100%;max-width:660px;overflow:hidden;border-radius:10px;" sandbox="allow-forms allow-popups allow-same-origin allow-scripts allow-storage-access-by-user-activation allow-top-navigation-by-user-activation" src="https://embed.music.apple.com/us/album/get-up-with-it/157447301"></iframe>\n',

        '\n<p>Not even 5 seconds into \u201cDownward Spiral\u201d, the opening track from Danny Brown\u2019s impeccable fourth album, things are already weird. Uneven beat, double bass and Brown\u2019s distinct delivery sound refreshingly different.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Produced primarily by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_White_(record_producer)">Paul White</a>, the beats borrow from unusual sources ranging from free jazz to New Order-inspired bass lines. But what else would you expect from a hip hop album named after a Joy Division song? The production is dark, lofi and claustrophobic. For the whole 47 minutes there\u2019s a persisting sense of dread and unease.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-full post-content-image" id="yui_3_17_2_1_1705011824957_81"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="955" height="535" src="http://localhost:8888/wordpress-trunk/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/2016_dannybrown_Saccenti_280916.hero_.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-386" srcset="https://qfn.fuu.mybluehost.me/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/2016_dannybrown_Saccenti_280916.hero_.jpg 955w, https://qfn.fuu.mybluehost.me/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/2016_dannybrown_Saccenti_280916.hero_-300x168.jpg 300w, https://qfn.fuu.mybluehost.me/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/2016_dannybrown_Saccenti_280916.hero_-768x430.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 955px) 100vw, 955px" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>But the beats are not the way they are on their own. The crippling dark atmosphere of this record only exists to compliment Brown\u2019s lyrics and delivery. As aptly summarized by (god forbid) <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-album-reviews/review-danny-browns-atrocity-exhibition-is-an-awesome-bummed-out-party-104845/">Rolling Stone</a>: \u201c[<em>Atrocity Exhibition</em>] is the year\u2019s most thrilling cry for help\u201d.<br>Brown\u2019s rhymes and flow are rooted in the old school. The wordplay has a prominent place here with rhymes like: \u201cMimosa for breakfast/With a thick ho from Texas\u201d and \u201cRocks about the size as the teeth in Chris Rock\u2019s mouth.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio embed-youtube"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">\n<iframe loading="lazy" title="Danny Brown - Ain&#039;t It Funny (Official Video, dir.

It\u2019s Danny Brown on top of his game.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<iframe style="border: 0; width: 100%; height: 120px;" src="https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=1940212110/size=large/bgcol=333333/linkcol=ffffff/tracklist=false/artwork=small/transparent=true/" seamless><a href="https://dannybrown.bandcamp.com/album/atrocity-exhibition">Atrocity Exhibition by Danny Brown</a></iframe>\n',

        '\n<p>Kill the Vultures are a hip hop band for John Cage and free jazz fans. Their music is peppered with Sun Ra samples and the instrumentals range from sparse double bass and not much else to almost punk rock workouts.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Kill The Vultures was formed in 2005 by former <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oddjobs">Oddjobs</a>\u2019 members Crescent Moon, Anatomy, Advizer, and Nomi. Dissatisfied with the direction Oddjobs was taking, the band started working on stuff that eventually became Kill The Vultures. According to Anatomy, they felt like it was more representative of what they were trying to achieve: <a href="http://www.hiphopcore.net/interviews/130%7Ceng-kill-the-vultures.html">\u201cI wanted to make something that was really minimalist, trashy and noisy\u201d</a>.<br>The same year (apart from releasing this gem) they were also chosen by City Pages as Best Hip-Hop Artist (faaaaaaame).<br>The musicians behind the mics and turntables actually spent years touring with De La Soul, DJ Shadow, Talib Kweli and others. At one point, Kill The Vultures even appeared on the cover of the Italian magazine <em>Blow Out</em>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-full post-content-image" id="yui_3_17_2_1_1705011699021_80"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="495" height="356" src="http://localhost:8888/wordpress-trunk/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Kill-The-Vultures.jpeg" alt="" class="wp-image-381" srcset="https://qfn.fuu.mybluehost.me/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Kill-The-Vultures.jpeg 495w, https://qfn.fuu.mybluehost.me/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Kill-The-Vultures-300x216.jpeg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 495px) 100vw, 495px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><em>Looking at you like at a vulture</em></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Musically, <em>Kill The Vultures</em> somehow manages to draw form many sources and spans vastly into many directions without ever being \u201cstraightforward\u201d. From the very first bars, \u201cLovin&#8217; You Dangerous\u201d snare sounds like factory machinery and immediately establishes the special atmosphere of the record. \u201cThe Vultures\u201d with its chanted chorus sounds like a drunken singalong (or rather <em>rap</em>along) whereas its heavy duty double bass provides a gloriously dusty bottom end. \u201cGood Intentions\u201d provides crooked jazzy double bass and haunting trumpet justifying the \u201curban noir\u201d label that Kill The Vultures put on themselves. \u201c7-8-9\u201d with its punk-influenced instrumental seems to venture a bit into a different direction while never fully departing from the established vibe.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Kill The Vultures</em> the album and the band might be overlooked by the vast majority of hip hop fans but once you\u2019ve unearthed this gem, you\u2019ll never let go \ud83d\udc8e&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<iframe style="border: 0; width: 100%; height: 120px;" src="https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=269751878/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=333333/tracklist=false/artwork=small/transparent=true/" seamless><a href="https://killthevultures.bandcamp.com/album/kill-the-vultures">Kill the Vultures by Kill the Vultures</a></iframe>\n',

        '\n<p>With hip hop being a prevalent force in music these days it makes it harder and harder to do something truly unique. Let alone being able to hold the title for almost 20 years.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Arrythmia</em>\u2019s album title is a rare example of a perfectly captured essence of the content. The beats, even though rooted in the hip hop tradition of the day, are never conventional. The lyrics are futuristic, weird and smart. After all two of the three MCs come from the ever-rewarding New York street poetry scene. Flawlessly mixing hip hop and IDM, it\u2019s not surprising that after a series of releases on their own Antipop Recordings, Anti-Pop Consortium got the attention of <a href="https://warp.net/">WARP records</a> known for releasing such behemoths as Aphex Twin, Autechre and Boards Of Canada.\u00a0</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-4-3 wp-has-aspect-ratio embed-youtube"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">\n<iframe loading="lazy" title="Antipop Consortium - Ghostlawns" width="500" height="375" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Zjp2HUY7dQY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>First thing you notice when putting on <em>Arrythmia</em> is the production. The beats drip intelligent weirdness bordering on brainy but never succumbing to the inaccessible. The sheer weirdness of the ideas that went into those beats are worthy of Sun Ra, who the band cite as a major influence. Contrary to the prevalent production methods of most hip hop of the era (and arguably even now) APC meticulously sculpt their drums from scratch without relying on dusty vinyl. The samples they utilize are following the drums closely in their unlikeliness: you can find chirping crickets, robotic video game bleeps, bubbling sounds, and \u2014 a highlight of hip hop production weirdness \u2014 an entire beat built around the bouncing ping pong ball (guess which one?).</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-full post-content-image" id="yui_3_17_2_1_1705011530995_85"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1000" height="1000" src="http://localhost:8888/wordpress-trunk/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/anti-pop-consortium.jpeg" alt="" class="wp-image-376" srcset="https://qfn.fuu.mybluehost.me/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/anti-pop-consortium.jpeg 1000w, https://qfn.fuu.mybluehost.me/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/anti-pop-consortium-300x300.jpeg 300w, https://qfn.fuu.mybluehost.me/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/anti-pop-consortium-150x150.jpeg 150w, https://qfn.fuu.mybluehost.me/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/anti-pop-consortium-768x768.jpeg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><em>The expressions you make while listening to </em>Arrythmia \u00a9 <em>ninjatune.net</em></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Upon original release, <em>Arrythmia </em>received enthusiastic reviews that did not necessarily translate into sales. The album made some minor waves in NYC but overall failed to reach wider audiences.<br>BUT! While reviewing it in 2021 it\u2019s impossible to miss just how refreshingly <em>different</em> the album sounds today. So much has been done in music since its release but very few came close to such a successful mix of WARP-style IDM and hip hop. Despite electronic music being at arguably its most mainstream and inventive at the same time.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Probably best said by Apple Music: \u201cNo one else was doing this style of hip-hop in 2002, and no one has pulled it off since.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<iframe style="border: 0; width: 100%; height: 120px;" src="https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=2203535680/size=large/bgcol=333333/linkcol=9a64ff/tracklist=false/artwork=small/transparent=true/" seamless><a href="https://warprecords.bandcamp.com/album/arrhythmia">Arrhythmia by Antipop Consortium</a></iframe>\n',

        '\n<p>Sure, this album is not <em>that</em> obscure. The main reason we decided to write about it is because it\u2019s just so awesome and so full of sun and summer. Besides, your mom probably never heard of them so how could we pass by it?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Saint Etienne (named after a French soccer club) were formed during the peak of indie dance in the UK when indie bands discovered MDMA and started going to clubs. The band\u2019s founders, Bob Stanley and Pete Wiggs originally planned to use a variety of different singers but after working with Sarah Cracknell on \u201cNothing Can Stop Us\u201d she joined the band as a permanent member. She has also written or co-written many of their songs.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-full post-content-image" id="yui_3_17_2_1_1705011382058_81"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="512" height="511" src="http://localhost:8888/wordpress-trunk/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Saint-Etienne.jpeg" alt="" class="wp-image-370" srcset="https://qfn.fuu.mybluehost.me/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Saint-Etienne.jpeg 512w, https://qfn.fuu.mybluehost.me/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Saint-Etienne-300x300.jpeg 300w, https://qfn.fuu.mybluehost.me/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Saint-Etienne-150x150.jpeg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 512px) 100vw, 512px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><em>So much larger than life they don\u2019t even fit in the frame</em></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the appeals of <em>Foxbase Alpha</em> and the reasons it aged so well is the relative DIY approach to production and strong underground qualities of the sound. While some other acts of the era (no pointing fingers here) made those huge dance records with bottomless budgets and chart success, Saint Etienne retained their non-mainstream sensibilities. Not that they did not achieve chart success, &#8220;Nothing Can Stop Us&#8221; and &#8220;Only Love Can Break Your Heart\u201d (a liberal reinterpretation of Neil Young) were both\u00a0<em>Billboard</em>\u00a0#1s on the dance charts. But you got the idea.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-4-3 wp-has-aspect-ratio embed-youtube"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">\n<iframe loading="lazy" title="Only Love Can Break Your Heart - Saint Etienne" width="500" height="375" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/vZAajrxvDs4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The sonic palette of <em>Foxbase Alpha </em>is broad and rewarding. According to Stanley: \u201cWe threw in as many of the things we loved as we could\u201d. You can find samples of rock, soul, dance, dub, whatever. All imaged through a prism of house-y beats, 60s pop and Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark. Oh, and London. Most of the reviewers note just how London this album is. They even have a song, \u201cGirl VII\u201d that lists London Underground stations and another song called \u201cLondon Belongs To Me\u201d.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Saint Etienne would have more success in the future, and there\u2019s an <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/music/reviews/m525/">opinion</a> that they made better albums than <em>Foxbase Alpha</em> but its honesty and lomo filter qualities are what make it a timeless album and an essential summer listen.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-spotify wp-block-embed-spotify wp-embed-aspect-21-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">\n<iframe title="Spotify Embed: Foxbase Alpha" style="border-radius: 12px" width="100%" height="352" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen allow="autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture" loading="lazy" src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/album/7e0mEjhM8D2x8E5c9H1oY3?go=1&#038;sp_cid=4ee5ae78b0fe5b2a952220851425f3a8&#038;utm_source=oembed&#038;utm_medium=desktop"></iframe>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<iframe allow="autoplay *; encrypted-media *; fullscreen *; clipboard-write" frameborder="0" height="450" style="width:100%;max-width:660px;overflow:hidden;border-radius:10px;" sandbox="allow-forms allow-popups allow-same-origin allow-scripts allow-storage-access-by-user-activation allow-top-navigation-by-user-activation" src="https://embed.music.apple.com/us/album/foxbase-alpha/302078938"></iframe>\n',

The band cites <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hi-Lo\'s">The Hi-Los</a><em> </em>and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter,_Paul_and_Mary">Peter, Paul and Mary</a> as major influences along with counterpoint experiments of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benjamin_Britten">Benjamin Britten</a><em>.<br></em>If you\u2019re feeling adventurous, you <strong>MUST</strong> check out <a href="https://youtu.be/l9CD48sDUoA">\u201cCuckoo\u201d by him</a> (featured in Wes Anderson\u2019s <em>Moonrise Kingdom</em>). It\u2019s sheer vocal excellence.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Free Design\u2019s trademarks were complex harmonies, odd (boll) time signatures and jazzy chord progressions courtesy of Chris\u2019 classical training. All displayed in full glory on <em>Kites Are Fun</em>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The music here is soooo 60s you\u2019d wanna wear sunglasses from all its sunshine qualities. There are certainly echoes of other \u201charmony\u201d groups of the era like The Beach Boys and Simon &amp; Garfunkel. Where The Free Design lack the songwriting skills of Brian Wilson or Paul Simon they easily compensate with the intricacy and complexity of their vocal arrangements. The lyrical themes follow the then-popular message of peace and love although the band were kinda looked down on by the hip crowd.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-4-3 wp-has-aspect-ratio embed-youtube"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">\n<iframe loading="lazy" title="The Free Design  - My Brother Woody" width="500" height="375" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/WlZNlk4Awwo?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite being signed to Project 3 almost immediately after recording their two-song demo, The Free Design failed to land a proper hit. The title track was the group&#8217;s only charting single, hitting #33 on the Billboard Adult Contemporary Charts, and #114 Pop. Paired with representing \u201csquare\u201d music they slowly faded into obscurity only to be rediscovered later on.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Stereolab, Cornelius, Beck and The High Llamas all cite The Free Design as an influence. 50+ years on their music sounds amazing and not at all uncool. As evidence of their continuing relevance Light In The Attic reissued their early albums back in 2003 and we\u2019re so glad they did!</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Note</em>: for the true sheet music aficionados out there, The Free Design actually sell sheet music to some of their songs on <a href="https://thefreedesign.com/products/sheet-music">their website</a>. \u201cKites Are Fun&#8217;\u201c is there, obv.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-spotify wp-block-embed-spotify wp-embed-aspect-21-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">\n<iframe title="Spotify Embed: Kites Are Fun" style="border-radius: 12px" width="100%" height="352" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen allow="autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture" loading="lazy" src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/album/48fGWaigrcztwtvaKYpvbR?go=1&#038;sp_cid=4ee5ae78b0fe5b2a952220851425f3a8&#038;utm_source=oembed&#038;utm_medium=desktop"></iframe>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<iframe allow="autoplay *; encrypted-media *; fullscreen *; clipboard-write" frameborder="0" height="450" style="width:100%;max-width:660px;overflow:hidden;border-radius:10px;" sandbox="allow-forms allow-popups allow-same-origin allow-scripts allow-storage-access-by-user-activation allow-top-navigation-by-user-activation" src="https://embed.music.apple.com/us/album/kites-are-fun/663456510"></iframe>\n',

        '\n<p>One of the pioneers of electronic music, the great Canadian composer Bruce Haack actually had a start in writing children\u2019s music (whaaaaaa?). The best part of it is that the music he made for children sometimes contained weird and surrealistic touches he\u2019s best known for. For example it could contain instructions like &#8220;When the music stops, be the sound you hear\u201d. I would LOVE to be the sounds I hear on <em>Electric Lucifer</em>. No, for real.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Though he had little formal training in electronics, he made synthesizers and modulators out of any gadgets and surplus parts he could find, including guitar effects pedals and battery-operated transistor radios. Eschewing diagrams and plans, Haack improvised, creating instruments capable of 12-voice polyphony and random composition. Using these modular synthesizer systems, he then recorded with two two-track reel-to-reel decks, adding a moody tape echo to his already moody pieces.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large post-content-image" id="yui_3_17_2_1_1705011050008_84"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="576" src="http://localhost:8888/wordpress-trunk/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/bruce-haack-1024x576.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-359" srcset="https://qfn.fuu.mybluehost.me/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/bruce-haack-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://qfn.fuu.mybluehost.me/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/bruce-haack-300x169.jpg 300w, https://qfn.fuu.mybluehost.me/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/bruce-haack-768x432.jpg 768w, https://qfn.fuu.mybluehost.me/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/bruce-haack.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><em>Bruce and his junk</em></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>As the 60s progressed and the general public became more accepting towards Haack\u2019s outlandish experimentations, his friend, collaborator, and business manager&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Kachulis">Chris Kachulis</a>&nbsp;found mainstream applications for his music. Like scoring commercials for example. Sure doesn\u2019t sound sexy, but Kachulis was his <em>business</em> manager after all. Haack also wrote a ballet and he used to do music for marionette window displays.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Haack continued promoting electronic music even appearing on&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mister_Rogers%27_Neighborhood"><em>Mister Rogers&#8217; Neighborhood</em></a>&nbsp;in 1968, where he demonstrated a homemade device and sampled <a href="https://youtu.be/n1UHOC16VCk">\u201cCitadel&#8221;</a> by the&nbsp;Rolling Stones.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Kachulis did another important favor for Haack by introducing him to&nbsp;psychedelic rock. Haack had previously \u201cexperimented\u201d with&nbsp;peyote,&nbsp;so acid rock&#8217;s expansive nature was a perfect match for his style. And so in 1970 he released his first rock-influenced work,&nbsp;<em>The Electric Lucifer.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>AllMusic&nbsp;describes this album as &#8220;a psychedelic, anti-war&nbsp;song cycle&nbsp;about the battle between heaven and hell.\u201d Not sure about heaven but he surely gives \u2018em hell on this one. Haack used a&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moog_synthesizer">Moog synthesizer</a>&nbsp;and his own home-built electronics, including an early prototype&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vocoder">vocoder</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-full post-content-image" id="yui_3_17_2_1_1705011050008_103"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="479" height="620" src="http://localhost:8888/wordpress-trunk/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/bruce-haack-ppl.jpeg" alt="" class="wp-image-360" srcset="https://qfn.fuu.mybluehost.me/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/bruce-haack-ppl.jpeg 479w, https://qfn.fuu.mybluehost.me/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/bruce-haack-ppl-232x300.jpeg 232w" sizes="(max-width: 479px) 100vw, 479px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><em>Hangin\u2019 out</em></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Sonically, the album is ahead of its time and a product of it. As a rock-based record, Haack\u2019s influences seem to be ranging from Doors\u2019 organ-infused passages to Mothers Of Invention inspired dadaist collages. Kachulis said in one of the interviews: \u201cWhen I used to meet with Bruce, I used to bring him vinyl recordings of a lot of the British bands of the era. He loved The Who, especially&nbsp;<em>Tommy</em>, and the Bee Gees concept works like&nbsp;<em>Odessa</em>. He didn\u2019t care for disco much, but he loved James Brown and Janis Joplin. He loved the concept albums The Moody Blues did, but his favourite was Cream. He\u2019d play them constantly, and he\u2019d get stoned while he listened to them. He painted a whole ceiling of stars and the solar system on the ceiling, and on his wall, he had cave paintings from prehistoric times. He loved that because he could see aliens in the paintings.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Unfortunately but unsurprisingly, the album was a flop. But Haack didn\u2019t seem to mind. He continued making more devilish music with the very next release, 1978 <em>Haackula</em> being darker than <em>Electric Lucifer</em>. A truly remarkable release exploring the possibilities of then very little explored concept of music made entirely with synthesizers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It\u2019s kinda curious how close Bruce Haack is sonically to another electronic pioneer and a proponent of the dark side, <a href="https://oddboll.net/home/mort-garson-mother-earths-plantasia">Mort Garson.</a> And they\u2019re both Canadian-born. Maybe there\u2019s something in the acid up there.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<iframe style="border: 0; width: 100%; height: 120px;" src="https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=2103610039/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/tracklist=false/artwork=small/transparent=true/" seamless><a href="https://brucehaackofficial.bandcamp.com/album/electric-lucifer">Electric Lucifer by Bruce Haack</a></iframe>\n',

No, seriously, the entire 7\u201d is just one locked groove with nothing but silence on it. Pretty cool, huh? Sure, <a href="https://youtu.be/JTEFKFiXSx4">John Cage</a> was there first but this release is different proving that you <em>can</em> make two different records of silence indeed. Again, very much what Kvitnu are all about.\u00a0</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio embed-youtube"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">\n<iframe loading="lazy" title="KOTRA &amp; ZAVOLOKA  -  SILENCE" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/oKtBTDsxFVQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Housed in a beautiful gatefold sleeve, the release is pressed on white vinyl with the single groove looking more like a minimalistic ornament than an actual recording. You might not ever play it but it would definitely be one of the most unusual releases in any record collection.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large post-content-image" id="yui_3_17_2_1_1705010588926_76"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="678" src="http://localhost:8888/wordpress-trunk/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Kotra-Zavoloka-22Silence22-2020-vinyl-1024x678.jpeg" alt="" class="wp-image-350" srcset="https://qfn.fuu.mybluehost.me/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Kotra-Zavoloka-22Silence22-2020-vinyl-1024x678.jpeg 1024w, https://qfn.fuu.mybluehost.me/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Kotra-Zavoloka-22Silence22-2020-vinyl-300x199.jpeg 300w, https://qfn.fuu.mybluehost.me/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Kotra-Zavoloka-22Silence22-2020-vinyl-768x509.jpeg 768w, https://qfn.fuu.mybluehost.me/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Kotra-Zavoloka-22Silence22-2020-vinyl.jpeg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><em>Isn\u2019t it beautiful?</em></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>There are many articles written on silence and whether it should or should not be considered music. The press release probably put it best: \u201cSILENCE IS ALWAYS HERE. SILENCE DOES NOT NEED TO BE FOUND NEITHER CREATED <em>(sic)</em>\u201d. Like white canvas, silence is the starting point, ground zero of music. This is what is there <em>before</em> the music begins.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Kvitnu was one of the most unusual labels out there and we would like to send our token of gratitude to this amazing label that now, just like that locked groove will forever be silent.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<iframe style="border: 0; width: 100%; height: 120px;" src="https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=3276813495/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=333333/tracklist=false/artwork=small/transparent=true/" seamless><a href="https://kvitnu.bandcamp.com/album/silence">Silence by Kotra &amp; Zavoloka</a></iframe>\n',

        '\n<p>We are living in what could be the most exciting age for music. The genres don\u2019t mean anything anymore, cliched rock music is dead and cutting-edge technology finds its way into popular music <a href="https://oddboll.net/home/holly-herndon-proto">more often</a>. With her debut album recorded while she was still in her mother\u2019s womb, Luca Yupanqui proves just how limitless modern music can be. AND it was released on one of our fav labels, <a href="https://oddboll.net/home/oddboll-spotlight-sacred-bones">Sacred Bones</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to the <a href="https://www.sacredbonesrecords.com/products/sbr270-luca-yupanqui-sounds-of-the-unborn">press release</a> \u201cSounds of the Unborn was made with biosonic MIDI technology, which translated Luca\u2019s in utero movements into sound.\u201d The album was recorded in several \u201cjoint meditation\u201d sessions by Luca\u2019s parents, Elizabeth Hart, Psychic Ills bassist, and Iv\u00e1n Diaz Math\u00e9, Lee \u201cScratch\u201d Perry collaborator.<br>According to them, they tried to edit the tracks as little as possible to keep the music raw. Every note on the album occurred naturally. Luca herself, an infant at the time of the album\u2019s mixing was present during the sessions and showed an astounding level of awareness.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio embed-youtube"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">\n<iframe loading="lazy" title="Luca Yupanqui - V4.3 pt. 2 (Official Music Video)" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/90g9Vqvx3yg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The music is definitely suitable to the idea behind it. It is ethereal, meditative. It doesn\u2019t have a single centre of attention rather morphing and evolving over time. It is far more than just an experiment for the experiment\u2019s sake. The way the sounds are glued together in a natural and organic way suggests something alien rather than human-made. <em>Sounds Of The Unborn</em> might be a great representation of infancy as an otherworldly experience: the listener has no idea what to expect when they hit play and once they do, what turn this album is going to take next. Just like a newborn for whom each moment of existence is a discovery.<br>You may not be a fan of experimental electronica but sheer curiosity should be more than enough to check out <em>Sounds Of The Unborn</em>.</p>\n\n\n\n<iframe style="border: 0; width: 100%; height: 120px;" src="https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=3142330752/size=large/bgcol=333333/linkcol=4ec5ec/tracklist=false/artwork=small/transparent=true/" seamless><a href="https://lucayupanqui.bandcamp.com/album/sounds-of-the-unborn">Sounds of the Unborn by Luca Yupanqui</a></iframe>\n',

        '\n<p>From a suburban emokid to a genre-bending artist, Sophia Bel\u2019s music is bold, different and a little weird. But we all love weirdos here, don\u2019t we? Check out Sophia\u2019s most recent <a href="https://bonsound.audiosalad.com/?xurl=26ac984b5906773fbd6b14532e2455b0a178b35e"><em>No More Remix EP</em></a><em> </em>packed with dancefloor-ready bangers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>With the music industry being virtually on halt what are you up to these days?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I\u2019m just trying to write music and not go crazy. When the curfew started I felt really claustrophobic but music helped. I always used songwriting to process things that I wasn\u2019t able to communicate otherwise. I think everyone had to do their own kind of soul searching and probably gotten to know themselves better. It decentered us and now we have to find our center again. But there are things that I already knew how to navigate. The lack of structure is something that artists usually know how to deal with.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>In one of the interviews you said that because of the pandemic we have to face ourselves because we are not distracted by other things anymore. Were you successful in facing yourself during the lockdown?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>It kind of goes from positive to negative and back. I think the strength that we find through the struggle is the best thing. A lot of people had more time so it seems that some friendships gotten stronger. Sometimes I feel that I had to face myself more than I wanted to but hopefully we\u2019ll all be stronger when life goes back to normal.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>You mentioned that you\u2019d like to make an album in the woods. Is it still a plan?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sometimes it\u2019s good to get away from the pressures of what you think you\u2019re supposed to be. Nature can be grounding. I know it sounds super cheesy but\u2026 <em>(laughs) </em>I did vocals for a&nbsp; TV show once and their studio was in the woods and I fell in love with concept.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Would you like to do it alone or with other people?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I would definitely bring some people with me. I love the synergy of other people\u2019s artistic intuition and sensibility. But they have to be right people.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>What is your approach to production/songwriting? If there are any patterns at all.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I feel there are many different patterns. When I first started writing it was a way for me to affirm myself. It helped me say things that I wouldn\u2019t say in real life. This aspect probably stayed with me. Wiring helps me organize certain feelings.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Your songs feel really personal and seem to be coming from within. Is that an integral part of your creative voice and would you write a song that is not based in your personal experience but is something you\u2019d like to talk about?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I don\u2019t want to talk about things I don\u2019t really know. Even if I write something external to me it still needs to relate to my personal experience. But then other people would listen to the song and it would mean something different for them. I like when a song becomes somebody else\u2019s story. It\u2019s fascinating to me.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-4-3 wp-has-aspect-ratio embed-youtube"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">\n<iframe loading="lazy" title="Sophia Bel - You&#039;re Not Real You&#039;re Just a Ghost (Official Music Video)" width="500" height="375" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/V8dO3VlpBCA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><a href="https://sophiabel.bandcamp.com/album/princess-of-the-dead-vol-i"><strong><em>Princess Of The Dead Vol. 1</em></strong></a><strong><em> </em>and </strong><a href="https://sophiabel.bandcamp.com/album/princess-of-the-dead-vol-ii-2"><strong><em>Princess Of The Dead Vol.2</em></strong></a><strong><em> </em>sound quite different. How did your approach change between the releases?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>With <em>Vol.1 </em>I literally just started producing and was just making demos. At the time I didn\u2019t feel that I was ready to produce an EP. When I met with <a href="https://soundcloud.com/cri-music">CRi</a> he was the first who respected my vision and the sound that I was gravitating towards. We took my initial demos and turned them into <em>Princess Of The Dead Vol.1</em>. With <em>Vol.2</em> I was more advanced with my skills and was able to bring more to the table in terms of production. <a href="https://sophiabel.bandcamp.com/track/no-more-2">\u201cNo More\u201d</a> was one of the first songs I produced and then CRi came in with the drum\u2019n\u2019bass drop and made it more dynamic. So I feel <em>Vol.2 </em>has a bit more me in it. It\u2019s always changing. <em>Vol.1 </em>had more of a trip hop vibe and <em>Vol.2&nbsp;</em> is a mixture of different things.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Can you imagine yourself going into a completely different direction? Maybe a pop country record?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I don\u2019t want to put labels on songs before they come into existence. If a song turns out to be a pop country song (which I highly doubt) then that\u2019s what it\u2019ll be. I want to be authentic.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>How do you produce your songs?</strong><br>I use Ableton. I also love using real instruments. I like to be as much outside the box as I can. I just bought and electric guitar. I also have a little synthesizer. Lately, I\u2019ve been coming back to my roots and writing songs on a guitar. Like when I was 15, just guitar, my voice and a notebook. Back to basics.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>How different are the songs?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you take out all other sounds and the arrangements you are able to see the bare bones of the song. Minimalism helps me see what parts I need to work on. But it\u2019s totally different from the electronic realm. It makes me push myself to achieve more dynamic songs with less. And it also seems to be beneficial when the song gets translated into a different style.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>How big of an influence was Montreal for you?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I\u2019m a suburban girl. I went to a private school and we had to wear a uniform and dying your hair or wear piercing was not allowed. I didn\u2019t have enough confidence to be who I wanted to be. It was not as open-minded as it can be in big cities. I met so many different kinds of people in Montreal. It took a lot of pressure off figuring out how to be myself because people here just are what they want to be and they do what they want. Nobody\u2019s going to judge you.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Musicians that I know have a strong artistic integrity and vision. I like that about Montreal culture. People value authenticity more than being famous. I feel that\u2019s what brought me out of my \u201cI wanna be a pop star\u201d mindset.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>What other non-musical influences (besides Montreal) could you name?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I try not to take myself too seriously. I sometimes add an element of self-deprecation to my songs. To me <a href="https://sophiabel.bandcamp.com/track/youre-not-real-youre-just-a-ghost-4">\u201cYou\u2019re Not Real You\u2019re Just A Ghost\u201d</a> has that kind of energy because I was just getting my angsty, insecure, needy teenager out of my system. I like to turn my troubles into something we can all have a little laugh at. It can soothe those feelings. That\u2019s the less musical element.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>You\u2019ve mentioned tarot cards and ten zen practice in previous interviews. How big of an influence are these practices on your creativity?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>For me it\u2019s mostly based on introspection and dealing with past trauma and connecting the dots between what we feel in our present with our past experiences. I am not a tarot expert. I see the cards as images that invoke something for you that has a potential to be therapeutic. It\u2019s like a conversation starter. I like to believe that we all have souls and that we are connected.\u00a0</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio embed-youtube"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">\n<iframe loading="lazy" title="Sophia Bel - No More (Official Music Video)" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/tTe5cDLStgs?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Switching the topic: do you feel like we need a 2000s comeback?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I feel there is a comeback already. I\u2019ve been rediscovering a lot of artists from the era. But it\u2019s mostly nostalgia for me. I think that the angsty emo vibe is something that people can connect with. The modern society seems to be very anxiety-inducing. I feel like the current generation is more depressed compared to the previous one. I don\u2019t want to victimize our generation but I feel like there were a lot of mental health issues that people didn\u2019t talk about before and now the conversation has exploded like a volcano.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I used to be obsessed with Fall Out Boy when I was 15 and now I\u2019m super into that kind of music: uptempo, angsty sadboy emo. The lyrics can sound a bit embarrassing now but when I was 15 it didn\u2019t matter because the music helped me process my issues.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That\u2019s something I was trying to put in my music lately: to let myself exaggerate and to be overly dramatic to get it out of my system.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>You\u2019ve mentioned that you discovered a lot of new music lately. What would be your biggest discoveries?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I\u2019ve been listening to a lot of sad French music lately. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fran%C3%A7oise_Hardy">Fran\u00e7oise&nbsp;Hardy&nbsp;</a>has become one of my favorites. She\u2019s the ultimate sadgirl from the 60s.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>What is your biggest guilty pleasure?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think Fall Out Boy\u2019s first album <em>(laughs)</em>. I\u2019m also into romantic melancholic Portuguese samba. Like <a href="https://youtu.be/7r1tKquhyzU">Perdido de Amor by Luiz Bonf\u00e1</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>What is your next big project?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>My next big project is my album. I just put out two EPs and an album is next. Next fall would be a good goal for me but it\u2019s far in the future and I would like to take my time with it. So far I\u2019ve been writing new songs on a guitar so they have a different vibe. I\u2019m trying to have enough confidence to be vulnerable and be able to express myself the way I want to.</p>\n\n\n\n<iframe style="border: 0; width: 100%; height: 120px;" src="https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=1782807857/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=63b2cc/tracklist=false/artwork=small/transparent=true/" seamless><a href="https://sophiabel.bandcamp.com/album/princess-of-the-dead-vol-i">Princess of The Dead, Vol. I by Sophia Bel</a></iframe>\n\n\n\n<div style="height:30px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>\n\n\n\n<iframe style="border: 0; width: 100%; height: 120px;" src="https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=3588161170/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=2ebd35/tracklist=false/artwork=small/transparent=true/" seamless><a href="https://sophiabel.bandcamp.com/album/princess-of-the-dead-vol-ii-2">Princess of The Dead, Vol. II by Sophia Bel</a></iframe>\n',

        '\n<p><a href="https://shabasonkrgovichharris.bandcamp.com/album/philadelphia"><em>Philadelphia</em></a>, the debut album from <strong>Shabason, Krgovich &amp; Harris</strong> was born out of mutual love for new age music among other things. After passing demos back and forth for about a year, the trio decided that to finish the record they have to get together in the same room. And so, over a few days in Toronto in fall of 2019 <em>Philadelphia </em>was made. We were supposed to interview the band but it ended up being mostly a chat among the three via a video call discussing everything from CN Tower to mindfulness to Dan Bejar to the extended state of idleness and deep cleaning.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>With the music industry being basically on halt, what are you guys up to these days?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Chris Harris</strong>: My schedule is pretty busy so I guess day job.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nick Krgovich</strong>: My life is similar to Chris\u2019 because we are not professional musicians. I put out albums and toured but sometimes I participate in that wheel and sometimes I don\u2019t.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Joseph Shabason:</strong> Nick also just finished a record that I had a pleasure of mixing and playing on. I don\u2019t wanna give away too much but it\u2019s really really good.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>NK</strong>: I recorded 16 songs if this Canadian songwriter, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veda_Hille">Veda Hille</a>, whom I was a fan of since I was 15 years old. It\u2019s coming out May, I hope.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>JS</strong>: I always had a friend of mine mix all the records but when we made <em>Philadelphia</em>, COVID happened shortly after and he had to move out of the city. Chris and Nick encouraged me to give it a try and it was the first album that I mixed myself. Since then I\u2019ve been doing a lot of mixing work. I also just finished an album of my own with the first single coming out <a href="https://josephshabason.bandcamp.com/album/the-fellowship">Feb 2</a>. I\u2019ve been doing a lot of scoring work and working on a public art project. COVID has been the busiest time of my life. Also taking care of a toddler.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>NK</strong>: I\u2019ve always done well with lots of idle time. I love not having anything to do. And I\u2019m really good at it!&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>JS</strong>: <em>(laughs)</em> Can you elaborate on that?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>NK</strong>: I feel that when life slows down to a pace when I get to call the shots, I just intuitively know how to move through the day. I think I\u2019m good at curating the day for others too. I\u2019ve had people call me when they are in a new town and I\u2019m like: \u201cWhat corner are you at? Okay, go to this place, and there is this thing there and so on.\u201d I just pay attention to dumb shit all the time and when you pay attention to dumb shit all the time you kinda become your own resource for dumb shit.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>JS</strong>: I think it\u2019s interesting that you\u2019re equally happy doing nothing. I\u2019m kinda same as you when it comes to managing my time but with extended periods of nothing I go insane.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>CH</strong>: I\u2019m more like Nick. I can spend two hours walking around a grocery store looking at food. COVID hasn\u2019t had that much of an impact on me except for that we used to swim in an outdoor pool which we can\u2019t do anymore.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>NK</strong>: I feel like I haven\u2019t done all the things I was planning to accomplish with all this free time. I haven\u2019t even done my yearly deep cleaning that I love to do.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>CH</strong>: It\u2019s almost February!</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>NK</strong>: I allow room for distractions. I might put on a record and get obsessed with it and start reading liner notes and Wikipedia.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio embed-youtube"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">\n<iframe loading="lazy" title="I Don&#039;t See The Moon by Shabason, Krgovich &amp; Harris" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2Fr0BXmVe5g?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Somehow <em>Philadelphia</em> feels like a reflection of life that we are now forced to have even though it was recorded before the pandemic. It almost seems like you were mentally ready or even anticipating this.&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>NK</strong>: <em>(nods and smiles)</em>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>CH</strong>: I would prefer not to be under lockdown although there seems to be a connection to the mundane that I\u2019ve always enjoyed. Like ambient music, focusing on the space around you. Going deeper. I also like the mask fashion. I wanted to wear a mask for years.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>NK</strong>: I also like boring stuff. It\u2019s a fertile territory for me to think about. White screen.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>JS</strong>: But we can all agree the CN tower is the most exciting.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>CH</strong>: Here we go.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>NK</strong>: What do you do up there?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>JS</strong>: This is a sidebar, because what you guys said was actually interesting. There is this restaurant that revolves 360 degrees during the course of your meal. It is amazing. <em>(Everybody laughs)</em>. You can see your house, you can see the lake. It is beautiful! It\u2019s boring but exciting.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>CH</strong>: So do you get jazzed up when eating on a flight?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>JS</strong>: No, because on a flight you\u2019re above god knows what.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>NK</strong>: Sometimes I look out the window on a flight and it looks terrifying. Like Greenland. It\u2019s crazy but there\u2019s something about it too. I don\u2019t feel like I\u2019m in danger but if I did a brain switch I\u2019m like: \u201cWhat am I doing here?\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>CH</strong>: There is never a moment on a flight when I\u2019m not blown away by what is happening. Like a newborn.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>NK</strong>: Sometimes I do this witchy thing and circle the plane with protective gold light.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>JS</strong>: That\u2019s my mom\u2019s jam too!</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio embed-youtube"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">\n<iframe loading="lazy" title="Shabason, Krgovich &amp; Harris - Wavelength Winter Festival 2021" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2zM4SlIWYtY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>The album was influenced by new age music and its overall sound is quite meditative. Was that the ultimate goal?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>JS</strong>: The first iteration of this was me, Nick and Chris saying okay, we all like this kind of music. Then we started sharing demos that were in that idiom. I think that the songs feel evocative and emotional. They\u2019re not shying away from the impulse to feel loving or peaceful. I think sometimes it goes into new age territory but sometimes goes into darker territories as well. It\u2019s a willingness for the music to feel overtly emotional. Why being dogmatic about what you can or cannot do? Why not use a flute or an ocarina?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>NK</strong>: With this album I don\u2019t think that we tried to confine it to any genre. I guess mindfulness of some sort came out because it was there somewhere, it wasn\u2019t on purpose.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>JS</strong>: It was quite free. Nick wrote all the lyrics on the spot as we were building up the songs. If you think about mindfulness as a practice of being in the moment, the sessions felt very much like that. We knew we had a finite amount of time and had to work hard but we didn\u2019t force anything. &nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>NK</strong>: I personally was in a nice place there. I wasn\u2019t consciously or unconsciously wrestling with anything in my mind at the time which was a nice relief.\u00a0</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio embed-youtube"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">\n<iframe loading="lazy" title="Friday Afternoon by Shabason, Krgovich &amp; Harris" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3fAiGAyIyY8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>I think the record has a really organic flow to it and the kind of cohesiveness that is often difficult to achieve.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>JS</strong>: One thing that might\u2019ve helped with that was watching Dan [Bejar from Destroyer] work. As a bandleader he lets people to do their thing and then edits it into something more concise. All three of us are picky editors and we had very specific thoughts about what was or wasn\u2019t working. So the spirit of playing was very spontaneous but there was significant editing afterwards. Nick remembered exactly what bar and what note he would like to change. He was the pickiest, the editing mastermind.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>CH</strong>: I still remember that one note on \u201cTuesday Afternoon\u201d that just rubbed me the wrong way. And it almost made it onto the record! I still anticipate it when I listen to the album.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>NK</strong>: It may sound that initially we were just throwing everything at the wall to see what stuck but the editing was actually just this little note here, this sound there. Very nuanced.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Wavelength festival is going to be your first \u201clive\u201d performance. How did you approach that with everything going on and you living on opposite coasts?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>JS</strong>: <em>(sighs)</em> It\u2019s weird. I\u2019m used to playing in the same room with people. We\u2019re approaching it as half live performance half something a bit more artistic. We are trying to reinterpret the songs so there is nothing edited down.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>CH</strong>: I\u2019m enjoying it as kind of an exercise. Having pieces and trying to construct something instead of just playing a show. I\u2019m excited to see what Derek [<a href="https://www.derekjanzen.info/">Janzen</a>] does with the video.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>What would you like to happen with this project?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>NK</strong>: I don\u2019t know. <em>(Laughs)</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>JS</strong>: We are going to make another album. We just have to wait until it\u2019s possible for us to get in the same room together again.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>NK</strong>: Now we made this thing so we can respond to it and see what comes next. And I want an award!</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>JS</strong>: No one expected anything, we could just be in the studio focusing on whatever made us feel happy. That\u2019s the part of the process that I would like to recreate. I miss just lying on the ground, listening, experimenting. I\u2019m certain that will happen again.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>NK</strong>: Oh, I\u2019d be so surprised if we felt any tension.\u00a0</p>\n\n\n\n<iframe style="border: 0; width: 100%; height: 120px;" src="https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=2583637458/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=333333/tracklist=false/artwork=small/transparent=true/" seamless><a href="https://shabasonandkrgovich.bandcamp.com/album/philadelphia">Philadelphia by Shabason, Krgovich &amp; Harris</a></iframe>\n\n\n\n<p>\ufeff<em>This interview was commissioned by and first appeared on </em><a href="https://www.wavelengthmusic.ca/shabason-krgovich-harris-the-wl-interview/?utm_campaign=shabason-krgovich-harris-the-wl-interview&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_source=rss"><em>wavelengthmusic.ca</em></a></p>\n',

        '\n<p>When it comes to certain shades of dark music, there is hardly any match for <a href="https://www.sacredbonesrecords.com/">Sacred Bones Records</a>. Since its establishment just over 10 years ago the label came a long way and is now home for many incredible artists including Zola Jesus, David Lynch, John Carpenter, Jenny Hval, Molchat Doma, Blanck Mass and many more. They are also responsible for a strain of incredible reissues from Mort Garson, Psychic TV, Julee Cruz and others.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sacred Bones was founded by Caleb Braaten in 2007. During its first years, the label was run from the basement of <a href="https://academy-lps.com/">Academy Records Annex</a> where Braaten also worked as a buyer. Prior to Sacred Bones, he was selling horror movie merch with a friend under the name \u201cMonster Squad\u201d. Under the same name they released a single by the local band Hunt and quickly realized that \u201cMonster Squad\u201d was <a href="https://www.villagevoice.com/2009/07/01/the-sacred-bones-label-finds-shades-of-dark/">\u201cthe worst name for a record label ever\u201d</a>. And so Sacred Bones was born and quickly established itself as a refuge for eerie, experimental and quite often lo-fi music.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-full post-content-image" id="yui_3_17_2_1_1705009096538_119"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="600" height="720" src="http://localhost:8888/wordpress-trunk/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/caleb-braaten.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-322" srcset="https://qfn.fuu.mybluehost.me/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/caleb-braaten.jpg 600w, https://qfn.fuu.mybluehost.me/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/caleb-braaten-250x300.jpg 250w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><em>Photo of a record with Caleb Braaten in the background</em></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>According to Braaten, he never expected the label to grow as big as it eventually did. He <a href="https://clrvynt.com/caleb-braaten-interview/?fbclid=IwAR2R8U0PRG2iRcCLtps45zhTJ2Kue7yGOYztd8NsFhOsBvjOVxcD3aOyRIY">believes</a>, that part of their success was time and place. He says, that there was a true DIY movement in NY at the time. These were the years when <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Todd_Patrick">Todd P</a> was active in the city. His events created a lo-fi DIY movement and many independent acts of the era gained early exposure at Todd P\u2019s shows:&nbsp; Black Lips, Lightning Bolt, Black Dice, Mount Eerie, Deerhunter, Dan Deacon, Matt and Kim, Real Estate, Pictureplane, Woods, USAISAMONSTER, Dirty Projectors, Surfer Blood, TV on the Radio, Gang Gang Dance, DIIV, Teengirl Fantasy, Kitty, No Age, Vivian Girls, and others.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The first true success story of Sacred Bones was Zola Jesus. Braaten found Nika Rosa Danilova on <a href="https://myspace.com/zolajesus">MySpace</a> (good old days) and began releasing her records. Her success helped Scared Bones to turn from a passion project into a successful label.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large post-content-image" id="yui_3_17_2_1_1705009096538_138"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="737" height="1024" src="http://localhost:8888/wordpress-trunk/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Zola_Jesus_@_Roadburn_Festival_2018-04-21_006_crop-737x1024.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-323" srcset="https://qfn.fuu.mybluehost.me/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Zola_Jesus_@_Roadburn_Festival_2018-04-21_006_crop-737x1024.jpg 737w, https://qfn.fuu.mybluehost.me/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Zola_Jesus_@_Roadburn_Festival_2018-04-21_006_crop-216x300.jpg 216w, https://qfn.fuu.mybluehost.me/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Zola_Jesus_@_Roadburn_Festival_2018-04-21_006_crop-768x1067.jpg 768w, https://qfn.fuu.mybluehost.me/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Zola_Jesus_@_Roadburn_Festival_2018-04-21_006_crop-1106x1536.jpg 1106w, https://qfn.fuu.mybluehost.me/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Zola_Jesus_@_Roadburn_Festival_2018-04-21_006_crop-1475x2048.jpg 1475w, https://qfn.fuu.mybluehost.me/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Zola_Jesus_@_Roadburn_Festival_2018-04-21_006_crop.jpg 1751w" sizes="(max-width: 737px) 100vw, 737px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><em>Zola Jesus as herself</em></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The signature <a href="https://www.sacredbonesrecords.com/collections/releases">design pattern</a> was actually conceived during a night of whiskey drinking. According to Braaten, he and Mike Sniper (who runs <a href="https://capturedtracks.com/">Captured Tracks</a> reissue imprint and makes noise-punk as Black Dogs) were listening to records when Braaten <a href="https://www.villagevoice.com/2009/07/01/the-sacred-bones-label-finds-shades-of-dark/">recalled</a> a classical record on Odyssey label he had and suggested doing the Black Dogs 12\u201d <em>Diana (The Herald) </em>like that: \u201cLots of text that tells you everything you need to know up-front\u2014some piece of weird art\u201d.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Apart from gorgeous covers, Sacred Bones are known for their incredible limited edition vinyl pressings. <a href="https://www.discogs.com/Jenny-Hval-The-Practice-Of-Love/release/14122151">Jenny Hval\u2019s&nbsp;<em>The Practice Of Love</em></a><em> </em>comes with tarot cards for each track, <a href="https://www.discogs.com/Blanck-Mass-Animated-Violence-Mild/release/14043527">Blanck Mass\u2019&nbsp;<em>Animated Violence Mild</em></a> includes two \u201cblood\u201d pills and <a href="https://www.discogs.com/Childrens-Hospital-Alone-Together/release/5172861">Children Hospital\u2019s&nbsp;<em>Alone Together</em></a> comes with a book of \u2014 you guessed it \u2014 1920s children\u2019s hospital patients.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can feel deep passion for the music and craft in everything Sacred Bones do. In just 13 years they managed to find their own voice and keep on growing and expanding. It is incredibly reassuring to see someone find such a seemingly odd niche and expand it into a beautiful (and dark) work of art.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We fell in love with Sacred Bones the moment we heard one of their releases for the first time. And we would love to share our finds with you! Below is our extremely subjective and definitely incomprehensive selection of our favorite Sacred Bones releases. Enjoy!</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Uniform, \u201cThe Long Walk\u201d (2018)</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>This record represents a heavier side of Sacred Bones. Ditching their usual drum-machines in favour of an actual drummer, <em>The Long Walk</em> represents a more live and rock-oriented approach to songwriting. The production is dirty and noisy and being recorded on analog tape creates a harsh sound that is abusive as it is satisfying.\u00a0</p>\n\n\n\n<iframe style="border: 0; width: 100%; height: 120px;" src="https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=150577187/size=large/bgcol=333333/linkcol=ffffff/tracklist=false/artwork=small/transparent=true/" seamless><a href="https://unifuckingform.bandcamp.com/album/shame">Shame by Uniform</a></iframe>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Hilary Woods, \u201cBirthmarks\u201d (2020)</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birthmarks</em> is an album of haunted beauty. Hilary Woods\u2019 vocals sound soft and tender but put against the background of dark and experimental folk the softness suddenly gains menacing undertones.\u00a0</p>\n\n\n\n<iframe style="border: 0; width: 100%; height: 120px;" src="https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=803293579/size=large/bgcol=333333/linkcol=ffffff/tracklist=false/artwork=small/transparent=true/" seamless><a href="https://hilarywoodsmusic.bandcamp.com/album/birthmarks">Birthmarks by Hilary Woods</a></iframe>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Jenny Hval, \u201cThe Practice Of Love\u201d (2019)</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>More accessible compared to Hval\u2019s other work, <em>The Practice Of Love </em>was inspired by trance music and contains more conventional pop songs with Hval\u2019s signature twist. <a href="https://www.discogs.com/Jenny-Hval-The-Practice-Of-Love/release/14122151">The vinyl edition</a> of the album featured a set of tarot cards, one for each song.</p>\n\n\n\n<iframe style="border: 0; width: 100%; height: 120px;" src="https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=1597900138/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=e99708/tracklist=false/artwork=small/transparent=true/" seamless><a href="https://jennyhval.bandcamp.com/album/the-practice-of-love">The Practice of Love by Jenny Hval</a></iframe>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Zola Jesus, \u201cThe Spoils\u201d (2009)</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The artist that helped establish Sacred Bones as a force to be reckoned with. The album was made by Nika Rosa in her apartment and features lo-fi production. The production quality was criticised even by her parents who said she needs to get into a real studio. Stylistically the album is a dreamy industrial blend that is a signature of Zola Jesus. Incredible and dark release.\u00a0</p>\n\n\n\n<iframe style="border: 0; width: 100%; height: 120px;" src="https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=150012277/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=333333/tracklist=false/artwork=small/transparent=true/" seamless><a href="https://zolajesus.bandcamp.com/album/the-spoils">The Spoils by Zola Jesus</a></iframe>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>John Carpenter</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>It\u2019s impossible to pick one single release from this iconic director and composer. His strain of Halloween soundtracks is absolutely uncanny. His solo albums feature a similar cinematic approach to songwriting and production. A true original unmatched in his art.\u00a0</p>\n\n\n\n<iframe style="border: 0; width: 100%; height: 120px;" src="https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=111669648/size=large/bgcol=333333/linkcol=e99708/tracklist=false/artwork=small/transparent=true/" seamless><a href="https://johncarpentermusic.bandcamp.com/album/halloween-original-motion-picture-soundtrack-expanded-edition">Halloween: Original Motion Picture Soundtrack (Expanded Edition) by John Carpenter, Cody Carpenter, and Daniel Davies</a></iframe>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>David Lynch, \u201cThe Big Dream\u201d (2013)</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>David Lynch\u2019s movies are a clear inspiration for Sacred Bones aesthetic. So it\u2019s only natural that he released his music with them. <em>The Big Dream</em> has its roots in blues music but the resulting songs are something different, described by Lynch himself as \u201cmodern blues\u201d. The music prominently features electronic experimentation blended with bluesy guitar songs.\u00a0</p>\n\n\n\n<iframe style="border: 0; width: 100%; height: 120px;" src="https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=1355606780/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=333333/tracklist=false/artwork=small/transparent=true/" seamless><a href="https://davidlynch.bandcamp.com/album/the-big-dream">The Big Dream by David Lynch</a></iframe>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Pharmakon, \u201cBestial Burden\u201d (2014)</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Pharmakon is one of the most original artists in modern experimental\u00a0 and industrial music. Deeply distorted and abrasive, her output retains incredible beauty and deepness. Coupled with her distinct visual style and intense live shows Pharmakon creates a truly remarkable experience.\u00a0</p>\n\n\n\n<iframe style="border: 0; width: 100%; height: 120px;" src="https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=495014158/size=large/bgcol=333333/linkcol=ffffff/tracklist=false/artwork=small/transparent=true/" seamless><a href="https://pharmakon.bandcamp.com/album/bestial-burden">Bestial Burden by Pharmakon</a></iframe>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Blanck Mass, \u201cAnimated Violence Mild\u201d (2019)</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>After Fuck Buttons went on hiatus, Benjamin Power started making music as Blanck Mass. Despite being put through a healthy amount of distortion, <em>Animated Violence Mild </em>is a truly melodic album. Power\u2019s production is textured and cinematic and instantly recognisable. <a href="https://www.discogs.com/Blanck-Mass-Animated-Violence-Mild/release/14043527">The limited vinyl edition</a> is absolutely glorious and shows exactly how much creativity and care Sacred Bones put into each of their releases.</p>\n\n\n\n<iframe style="border: 0; width: 100%; height: 120px;" src="https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=1302611116/size=large/bgcol=333333/linkcol=2ebd35/tracklist=false/artwork=small/transparent=true/" seamless><a href="https://blanckmass.bandcamp.com/album/animated-violence-mild">Animated Violence Mild by Blanck Mass</a></iframe>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Marissa Nadler, \u201cStrangers\u201d (2016)</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Marissa Nadler doesn\u2019t need abusive synthesisers and walls of distortion to sound dark. Her folky songs are deeply rooted in goth and evoke imagery of something medieval. The soft pianos and guitars accompany Nadler\u2019s haunting vocals with underlying textured soundscapes adding dark ambience to the mix.\u00a0</p>\n\n\n\n<iframe style="border: 0; width: 100%; height: 120px;" src="https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=1055123274/size=large/bgcol=333333/linkcol=ffffff/tracklist=false/artwork=small/transparent=true/" seamless><a href="https://marissanadler.bandcamp.com/album/strangers">Strangers by Marissa Nadler</a></iframe>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Moon Duo, \u201cCircles\u201d (2012)</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite retro-leaning reverb on the vocals and noisy guitars, Moon Duo\u2019s music represents a different side of Sacred Bones. Their music is not necessarily dark and probably could be described as \u201cfun\u201d. Despite the stark contrast to some of the label\u2019s artists, Moon Duo still feel like a perfect fit. After listening to just a few of their songs it suddenly becomes clear why they are on the same label as their sonically abusive counterparts.\u00a0</p>\n\n\n\n<iframe style="border: 0; width: 100%; height: 120px;" src="https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=1128170233/size=large/bgcol=333333/linkcol=2ebd35/tracklist=false/artwork=small/transparent=true/" seamless><a href="https://moonduo.bandcamp.com/album/circles">Circles by Moon Duo</a></iframe>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>The Soft Moon, \u201cCriminal\u201d (2018)</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Post-punk project The Soft Moon is a brainchild of Luis Vasquez. Written in Berlin, were Velasquez resided at the time, this album features more raw anger than his previous work. Pulsating bass, marching cadence of drums and distorted synth provide a factory-like background to Velasquez\u2019s distant and reverberated vocals.\u00a0</p>\n\n\n\n<iframe style="border: 0; width: 100%; height: 120px;" src="https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=3874211033/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=333333/tracklist=false/artwork=small/transparent=true/" seamless><a href="https://thesoftmoon.bandcamp.com/album/criminal">Criminal by The Soft Moon</a></iframe>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>The Men, \u201cOpen Your Heart\u201d (2012)</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Men are one of those bands that don\u2019t abide by any rules. Rooted in punk and sometimes sounding like they were recorded in a basement at a DIY show, The Men can easily move between ballsy punk, overdriven hardcore bordering on metal and melodic noisy indie. A truly one of a kind band.</p>\n\n\n\n<iframe style="border: 0; width: 100%; height: 120px;" src="https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=2087720637/size=large/bgcol=333333/linkcol=9a64ff/tracklist=false/artwork=small/transparent=true/" seamless><a href="https://themen.bandcamp.com/album/open-your-heart">Open Your Heart by The Men</a></iframe>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Mort Garson reissues</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Omg, should we even start on those? Every single one of them is amazing. We already wrote about <a href="https://oddboll.net/home/mort-garson-mother-earths-plantasia">Mother Earth\u2019s Plantasia</a> and the recent batch is equally impeccable. Get them all!\u00a0</p>\n\n\n\n<iframe style="border: 0; width: 100%; height: 120px;" src="https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=2359873007/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=7137dc/tracklist=false/artwork=small/transparent=true/" seamless><a href="https://mortgarson.bandcamp.com/album/music-from-patch-cord-productions">Music from Patch Cord Productions by Mort Garson</a></iframe>\n\n\n\n<p>Support Sacred Bones in their awesomeness on their <a href="https://www.sacredbonesrecords.com/">website</a>. oddboll earns no commision from the link and are doing it solely for the purpose of art.</p>\n',

        '\n<p>2020 has been a challenging, disappointing and plain sucky year for most. All of our plans essentially went to shit and our favorite artists couldn\u2019t be there for us just as we couldn\u2019t be there for them. Yet, this was an incredible year for music that once again proved that creativity cannot be hindered by the state of the industry.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And after all it\u2019s been a great year for us because 2020 is when oddboll started! And who knows, maybe if it hadn\u2019t been for the spring lockdowns we would\u2019ve taken even longer to get ourselves together and do it.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The list below is not ordered in any way. We don\u2019t believe in ratings, rankings, points or stars. The music we write about is already great so there is no point in rating it. And the life\u2019s too short to focus on bad music anyway. So, in no particular order, here are some of the albums that we couldn\u2019t get enough of in 2020:</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><a href="https://oddboll.net/home/desire-marea-desire"><strong>Desire Marea,&nbsp;<em>Desire</em></strong></a></h3>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-full post-content-image" id="yui_3_17_2_1_1705008654803_67"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="600" height="600" src="http://localhost:8888/wordpress-trunk/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Desire-Marea-22Desire22-2020-cover.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-88" srcset="https://qfn.fuu.mybluehost.me/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Desire-Marea-22Desire22-2020-cover.jpg 600w, https://qfn.fuu.mybluehost.me/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Desire-Marea-22Desire22-2020-cover-300x300.jpg 300w, https://qfn.fuu.mybluehost.me/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Desire-Marea-22Desire22-2020-cover-150x150.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Coincidentally, one of our first posts <a href="https://oddboll.net/home/desire-marea-desire">here</a>. Desire\u2019s music has been with us for most of 2020 and we still can\u2019t get enough of it. Their music is futuristic yet familiar, dark yet heavenly. It goes from club-ready gqom to distorted howls from hell in mere minutes.

Cook released more than one album in 2020, but it is <em>7G</em> that we listened to the most. Not only it\u2019s quite an ambitious project with 49 tracks clocking in at over 2.5 hours but it\u2019s also equally rewarding.

        '\n<p><em>Despite being a very much underground band, Clear Gash showcase an incredible knack for abrasive noise rock on their second release. In the wake of the release of </em><a href="https://oddboll.net/home/clear-gash-what-you-want-to-see">What You Want To See</a>, <em>oddboll had a chat with the band\u2019s vocalist, Paul.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>odd: Good morning! How is it going?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Paul: Going pretty well, I guess.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Can you tell us about Clear Gash? How did you guys start?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The band started a while ago as Crude Gash. They released a <a href="https://iniquity.bandcamp.com/album/down-it-goes-now">demo album</a> and after that renamed themselves Clear Gash and released <a href="https://iniquity.bandcamp.com/album/replenish"><em>Replenish</em></a>. I knew these guys since\u2026I don\u2019t know\u2026for a while. At the time Fabse was doing the vocals but he was not a big fan of being a vocalist. So one day he came up to me and was like: \u201cPaul, would you mind doing vocals in Clear Gash?\u201d and I was like: \u201cYeah, absolutely!\u201d. I liked their music for a while and did sound for them once. I just came by their rehearsal one day, wrote some lyrics, did some vocals. The songs were already written. These songs ended up on the new EP but they changed quite a bit.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Is this your first band?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>No, all the guys have been in other bands, including me. We also have different bands now. We have all been making music since we were 14 or 15. But for everybody it\u2019s kinda main focus. Every other project we have is more filling in the blanks while the new Clear Gash stuff is in the works.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-full post-content-image" id="yui_3_17_2_1_1705008438783_71"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="395" height="313" src="http://localhost:8888/wordpress-trunk/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/cleargash3.jpeg" alt="" class="wp-image-299" srcset="https://qfn.fuu.mybluehost.me/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/cleargash3.jpeg 395w, https://qfn.fuu.mybluehost.me/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/cleargash3-300x238.jpeg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 395px) 100vw, 395px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><em>The gang\u2019s all here (including </em><a href="https://convergecult.bandcamp.com/album/jane-doe"><em>Jane Doe</em></a><em>)</em></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>What went into making <em>What You Want To See</em>? What inspired you while writing it?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I guess a lot of music that we liked and a lot of ideas that we were trying to do for a while but didn\u2019t really have a chance. For every band member it\u2019s kind of like a passion project. A way to create ideas that have been with you for a while. Every musician says that and it\u2019s kind of stupid to say but it\u2019s like an outlet of sorts for everything that\u2019s been with us recently.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>What are you looking for with Clear Gash? How would you describe what your music is?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Style wise it doesn\u2019t have a certain idea of how we want it to sound. Just something that comes together. New songs we write are completely different. This EP is different from the album before. We don\u2019t say: \u201cWe want to create this and that\u201d. Somebody comes up with an idea and we try it out, see if we like it. If we do \u2014 we record it and put it out. There is no \u201coverall vision\u201d.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>More of an organic approach?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah, I guess so.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>We saw that photograph on Facebook with the guitar stuck in the pipes on the ceiling. Is something like that a part of your creative process? What is your creative process like?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Normally, Fabse comes up with a riff or an idea for a song and then we start working on it. It would change a million times. First draft is usually completely different from what ends up on the recording. Four out of five rehearsals are just us fucking around and having fun. Sometimes we joke around and do stuff like putting a guitar in the ceiling or whatever and it turns out to be a good idea. I would do a stupid scream for fun but then when listening back we would realize that it is actually sounded kinda cool.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Happy accidents, right?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah, I guess so, haha.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large post-content-image" id="yui_3_17_2_1_1705008438783_90"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="762" height="1024" src="http://localhost:8888/wordpress-trunk/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/IMG_9393-762x1024.jpeg" alt="" class="wp-image-300" srcset="https://qfn.fuu.mybluehost.me/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/IMG_9393-762x1024.jpeg 762w, https://qfn.fuu.mybluehost.me/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/IMG_9393-223x300.jpeg 223w, https://qfn.fuu.mybluehost.me/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/IMG_9393-768x1032.jpeg 768w, https://qfn.fuu.mybluehost.me/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/IMG_9393.jpeg 1072w" sizes="(max-width: 762px) 100vw, 762px" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>What were your influences behind <em>What You Want To See</em>? Maybe not just music related influences?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Musically it\u2019s usually the stuff we are into when writing or recording the songs. For example the opener [\u201cMake Them | Devour Them\u201d] sounds like <a href="https://raspberrybulbs.bandcamp.com/">Raspberry Bulbs</a> to me. The lyrics and overall imagery are inspired by grindhouse movies, late 70s horror stuff. I don\u2019t necessarily sing about those things but the overall vibe comes from it. I like trying to interpret visuals in sound, if it makes sense.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Yeah, you can certainly feel the atmosphere! You write and produce your music yourselves, right?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yes. We record in our rehearsal room. Then make a rough mix and give it to our friend who is a professional mixer. We make the artwork ourselves and dub the tapes ourselves. Andy\u2019s grandma has screen printing equipment at her home so we can even do merch ourselves. We don\u2019t have the money to make vinyl but apart from that we can make pretty much everything.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>All DIY.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah! Not so much because of the attitude and because we are so punk. We are just too lazy to write emails to labels, haha.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>If you had a chance to sign with a major label or even become a more of a \u201cpop\u201d band, would you do it?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah, absolutely! I don\u2019t feel that it means \u201cselling out\u201d. I don\u2019t think that you\u2019re \u201cselling out\u201d if you\u2019re getting a major label deal. You can but there are bands who stay true to their roots despite being on major labels.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>What is your stance on physical releases? Are you making tapes to make money or do you believe in releasing music in such way?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>It\u2019s super cool that you can release your music digitally on Bandcamp where anyone could listen to it for free and it\u2019s so easy to do. But there is something about having a cassette tape or a vinyl record of your release. It makes it a bit more real. You put so much work into your release and once you have a physical copy of it in your hands, it feels like it all paid off a bit more. It\u2019s not about making money because we make our tapes very cheap and we sell them very cheap. It\u2019s just a nice feeling. Also packaging is another way to show your ideas.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>As a Germany-based band, is there any particular reason why all of your songs are in English?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>We actually have some new songs that are in German. Some lyrics just sound nicer in English. Maybe one day I\u2019ll write lyrics in Swedish or some other language. Different languages have different sound to them and sometimes it just fits better. It\u2019s not so everybody can understand them because we don\u2019t print our lyrics anyway. Writing in German is also difficult for me because I feel like I need to try even harder.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>When working on a release are you trying to achieve a certain \u201cperfect sound\u201d or are you just in the moment making whatever you feel like?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>We definitely want to have a certain sound for a release. For example the first song we recorded took forever because we did so many takes, like 40 or so. We all really wanted it to be just how we imagined it, to be perfect. Maybe that\u2019s why it takes us so long to release music.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-full post-content-image" id="yui_3_17_2_1_1705008438783_99"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="600" height="800" src="http://localhost:8888/wordpress-trunk/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/cleargash2.jpeg" alt="" class="wp-image-301" srcset="https://qfn.fuu.mybluehost.me/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/cleargash2.jpeg 600w, https://qfn.fuu.mybluehost.me/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/cleargash2-225x300.jpeg 225w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><em>Clearing the gash</em></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>What is your most unlikely source of inspiration?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Each of us has a something we\u2019re into that people wouldn\u2019t expect. For me it\u2019s bands like Devo or Blondie. Our drummer is into hip hop like <a href="https://oddboll.net/home/mf-doom-mmfood">MF Doom</a>. People wouldn\u2019t necessarily get it from our music. It maybe even so deep within us that we don\u2019t realize that it influences us. We may even unintentionally steal from other bands, haha.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>What are some of your desert island disks?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>For me it\u2019s <em>Dimension Hatr\u00f6ss</em> by Voivod, <em>Oh, No! It\u2019s Devo</em> by Devo, <em>Melted</em> by Ty Segall and <em>Death Fiend</em> by Hellhammer.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>If you had a chance to work with any artist in the world who would you choose?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I guess we\u2019d all like to work with the people from Fat White Family. They seem to be cool musicians and cool people to hang out with. I don\u2019t know, it\u2019s hard to say because the stuff we\u2019re into changes so often. There are too many musicians and I can\u2019t think of anybody right now.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>Replenish</em> was released on a pretty interesting label, </strong><a href="https://iniquity.bandcamp.com/music"><strong>Iniquity Recordings</strong></a><strong>. What is this label?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>It\u2019s our drummer\u2019s label. Most of the stuff released there involves one of us. A side project or an old band. It\u2019s a way for us to release other projects and explore other styles.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Would you say there is a scene in Bruchsal which you consider yourselves a part of?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>No, absolutely not <em>(laughs)</em>. There are some cool musicians in Karlsruhe but there\u2019s nothing in Bruchsal. The scene here is shit. No cool underground concerts to anything like that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>What about shows? Do you play in other cities?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Clear Gash did shows in Karlsruhe and Pforzheim, which was self-organized. It was kinda building up for us to have more shows but then the whole \u201c2020 situation\u201d happened and everything was cancelled. I hope we will play more after this whole thing is over. We\u2019d love to play more but there are not that many opportunities in our area.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Would you consider relocating eventually?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I don\u2019t know, I guess not. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s worth it just to be able to play more shows. I think we\u2019ve all accepted it. You can\u2019t stay angry all the time. We would like to organize a few shows ourselves and improve the scene here. I feel like I\u2019d rather make a scene here than go somewhere where there is a scene already. It\u2019s too easy. It\u2019s hard to do, maybe even impossible but you might as well try. You will be more proud if you do it yourself.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>What are your plans for 2021?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Finishing our next release, probably an album. We don\u2019t want to rush it, but I feel like once we\u2019re allowed to rehearse again we\u2019ll be super motivated.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Can you tell us about other projects you\u2019re involved in?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I play in a band that is kind of like old school black metal. Then I did <a href="https://iniquity.bandcamp.com/album/you-better-shiver">Electric Dispoiler&nbsp;</a>which is synth-based punk stuff. Right now I\u2019m working on something that is more poppy rock-n-roll with synths. Andy has an electro band. They all played in <a href="https://iniquity.bandcamp.com/album/bad-education">Liver Values</a> which was a powerviolence band. <a href="https://iniquity.bandcamp.com/album/back-to-primitive">Devour The Blessed</a> was a grindcore band. We all tend to make more of a harsh music but we are also trying out different things. We just do what we\u2019re into. Back in the day we all started with black metal, death metal, grindcore but then we\u2019ve gotten more into punk and new wave and so on.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>What do you outside of music?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I work as an event technician. Fabse is a carpenter. Andy builds parts for motors and machines. Dario is doing printing. We all have regular daytime jobs, something we like to do outside of music. All of us also enjoy art or illustration to a degree.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Do you make your covers yourselves?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah. The <em>Replenish </em>cover was done by Fabse. The new one was done by me. It feels natural to make our own covers because we know the music.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>There is not much information about you online. What would you like for people to know about you?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Uhm\u2026 I gotta come up with a good one now. We do not like ska punk! That\u2019s all I have to say.</p>\n\n\n\n<iframe style="border: 0; width: 100%; height: 120px;" src="https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=2463614598/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=333333/tracklist=false/artwork=small/transparent=true/" seamless><a href="https://cleargash.bandcamp.com/album/what-you-want-to-see">What You Want To See by Clear Gash</a></iframe>\n',

        '\n<p>Noise music itself is hard, if not impossible to define. Our fascination with it is, perhaps, even more unnatural. And yet there is something mysteriously captivating in harsh, loud and abrasive sounds. Clear Gash are not strictly speaking a \u201cnoise\u201d band (just because they\u2019re so much more) but harsh and abrasive are certainly the words to use.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>What You Want To See</em> is only their second release (after a 2019 full length <a href="https://iniquity.bandcamp.com/album/replenish"><em>Replenish</em></a>) but their identity is nevertheless fully formed. The guitar sounds like chainsaw through metal, the bass is trying to rip the speaker and the hypnotic drums patterns provide a backbone to this bacchanalia of sonic abuse. Buried within all this and drenched in reverb is the vocal that goes from seemingly commanding a satanic ritual to reminding of cries for help of a kidnapping victim in an abandoned basement.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-full is-resized post-content-image" id="yui_3_17_2_1_1705008162769_71"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="384" height="512" src="http://localhost:8888/wordpress-trunk/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/cleargash1.jpeg" alt="" class="wp-image-295" style="width:384px;height:auto" srcset="https://qfn.fuu.mybluehost.me/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/cleargash1.jpeg 384w, https://qfn.fuu.mybluehost.me/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/cleargash1-225x300.jpeg 225w" sizes="(max-width: 384px) 100vw, 384px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><em>Some chillen\u2019 goin\u2019 on</em></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Right from the first sweep of distorted noise of the EPs opener \u201cMake Them | Devour Them\u201d Clear Gash show that they\u2019re not here to fuck around. The track builds up the tension only to drop down in full during the second half when faster tempos send everything into a frenzy of ear-bleeding proportions. \u201cTongues\u201d is Bauhaus through a distortion unit. Pulsating rhythm section provides a mesmerizing backbone to a wall of screeching guitar noise and demonic vocals. \u201cPick Me\u201d is more of a punkish track with faster drums and guitars trying to rip your eardrums apart. &nbsp;The EP closer is a Swell Maps cover, <a href="https://youtu.be/EpxQ5ZDDA6Y">\u201cNew York\u201d</a>. Clear Gash\u2019s version stays true to the original in terms of general approach but provides a signature blend of assaulting guitars and straight-outta-horror movie vocals.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>What You Want To See</em> is concise and to the point. It is the kind of a release you want to play again right after the first listen to catch more of that noisy magic. Clear Gash sounds like they know what they\u2019re doing and are not afraid of going full on when it comes to assaulting the listener with swarms of noises pushed all the way into the clipping territory.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to the band\u2019s vocalist, Paul, Clear Gash are perfectionists taking a lot of time to polish the songs and achieve the exact sound they\u2019re looking for. This approach is on full display here as the relatively new band sounds like they&#8217;ve been playing together for a long time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>oddboll had a pleasure to speak to Paul via Google Meet the other day. Read our full interview <a href="https://oddboll.net/home/clear-gash-interview">here</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Find the release below and please, support the guys through march or tapes, if you can.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<iframe style="border: 0; width: 100%; height: 120px;" src="https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=2463614598/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=333333/tracklist=false/artwork=small/transparent=true/" seamless><a href="https://cleargash.bandcamp.com/album/what-you-want-to-see">What You Want To See by Clear Gash</a></iframe>\n',

        '\n<p>There is nothing conventional about Coil. Since its inception in the early 80s, they were the driving force in dark and occult music. Their art was a huge influence on dark ambient, goth, neofolk, dark folk and related dark-from-centre genres. Initially conceived as a solo project by John Balance (of Psychic TV) Coil evolved into a duo with the addition of Balance\u2019s partner, Peter \u201cSleazy\u201d Christopherson (of Throbbing Gristle).&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After releasing a strain of highly influential albums in the 80s and early 90s (including <em>Scatology</em> (1984), <em>Horse Rotorvator</em> (1986) and <em>Love\u2019s Secret Domain</em> (1991) the band struggled financially in the early 90s. 1999 saw their return to form with <em>Astral Disaster</em> and the first instalment in the <em>Musick To Play In The Dark</em> series.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-full post-content-image" id="yui_3_17_2_1_1705008035915_76"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1007" height="500" src="http://localhost:8888/wordpress-trunk/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Coil-thevinylfactory.com_.png" alt="" class="wp-image-291" srcset="https://qfn.fuu.mybluehost.me/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Coil-thevinylfactory.com_.png 1007w, https://qfn.fuu.mybluehost.me/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Coil-thevinylfactory.com_-300x149.png 300w, https://qfn.fuu.mybluehost.me/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Coil-thevinylfactory.com_-768x381.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1007px) 100vw, 1007px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><em>How my mom sees my friends \u00a9thevinylfactory.com</em></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Coil called this album \u201cmoon music\u201d and it combines a wide range of styles including ambient, glitch, minimalism, krautrock with some dark and twisted take on jazziness.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The production began after Coil moved into a new studio with some new equipment. Among others they used <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optigan">Optigan</a>, an array of vintage drum machines, Roland SH-101, Synton Fenix as well as Pro Tools. John Balance originally intended to write liner notes for the release but they ended up only being published on Coil\u2019s website. In those notes, he explained the meaning behind some of the songs. \u201cAre You Shivering?\u201d refers to an MDMA trip he had when he and his friends &#8220;would ask if each other were shivering, as pure doses can make the teeth chatter and the eyesight vibrate\u201d. \u201cBroccoli\u201d is &#8220;about greens and ancestor worship\u201d and \u201cStrange Birds\u201d evokes a moment when Balance &#8220;regressed to BIRD MIND and only squawked and chirruped for three worrying days\u201d. As if anyone would&#8217;ve expected any less from Coil.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While embracing contemporary technology and adding <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Granular_synthesis">granular synthesis</a> and digital glitch effects, Balance and Christopherson still manage to retain certain warmth that was typical to their icon 80s albums.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As it is the case with many albums we are covering here, <em>Musick To Play In The Dark</em> is a world of its own and it continues to exist outside of time. This album together with the rest of Coil\u2019s output continues to inspire countless musicians looking for \u201cthe other side\u201d of the music and it will another 20 years from now.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The record was recently reissued and the new reissues look absolutely stunning! Check them out <a href="https://www.daisrecords.com/products/coil-musick-to-play-in-the-dark">here</a>.

        '\n<p>The Knife didn\u2019t bless us with quantity of their output but what we are left with is sheer quality. Their final album (hopefully to date), <em>Shaking The Habitual</em> is an indication of just how great and capable this band was.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Formed in 1999 by siblings Karin and Olof Dreijer, The Knife unleashed their self-titled debut in 2001. Although already a fully accomplished offering from the start, they achieved real fame with their sophomore <em>Deep Cuts</em>. Containing their biggest commercial hit, <a href="https://youtu.be/pPD8Ja64mRU">\u201cHeartbeats\u201d</a>\ufeff, the album was met with widespread critical acclaim and made tons of end of year and best of the decade lists. The song was covered by many acts, most notably Jos\u00e9 Gonz\u00e1lez. <a href="https://youtu.be/HxJhYpTIrl8">His version of the song</a> was even used in a BMW commercial. Despite The Knife\u2019s anti-commercial stance they agreed to the deal explaining that they needed the money to establish their own record company.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-full post-content-image" id="yui_3_17_2_1_1705007906344_76"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="619" height="412" src="http://localhost:8888/wordpress-trunk/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/The-Knife-clashmusic.com_.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-286" srcset="https://qfn.fuu.mybluehost.me/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/The-Knife-clashmusic.com_.jpg 619w, https://qfn.fuu.mybluehost.me/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/The-Knife-clashmusic.com_-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 619px) 100vw, 619px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><em>Counting crows (hint: 2) \u00a9clashmusic.com</em></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Fast forward 7 years and the band unleashed their final work. <em>Shaking The Habitual</em> takes its name from a quote by French philosopher Michel Foucault. The album\u2019s themes lie in feminist and queer theory adding structuralism and environmentalism. They criticise nuclear family calling it &#8220;an institution that conserves inequality, injustice and exclusion\u201d. They believe &#8220;in solidarity beyond nuclear families, nations and economical unions\u201d. <a href="https://pitchfork.com/features/interview/9092-the-knife/">When talking to Pitchfork</a> Karin said that &#8220;people would be happier sharing things and being much more of a collective rather than working from these neo-liberal ideas of just looking after yourself.\u201d&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Such strong political stance is nothing new for The Knife. After winning the Swedish Grammis, the duo boycotted the ceremony and send members of <a href="https://www.guerrillagirls.com/">Guerrilla Girls</a> with number 50 written on their costumes as a protest against male dominance in the music industry.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large post-content-image" id="yui_3_17_2_1_1705007906344_95"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="683" src="http://localhost:8888/wordpress-trunk/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/fever-ray-redbull.com_-1024x683.jpeg" alt="" class="wp-image-287" srcset="https://qfn.fuu.mybluehost.me/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/fever-ray-redbull.com_-1024x683.jpeg 1024w, https://qfn.fuu.mybluehost.me/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/fever-ray-redbull.com_-300x200.jpeg 300w, https://qfn.fuu.mybluehost.me/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/fever-ray-redbull.com_-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://qfn.fuu.mybluehost.me/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/fever-ray-redbull.com_.jpeg 1500w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><em>Karin Dreijer performing as Fever Ray \u00a9redbull.com</em></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the greatest things about The Knife is that they\u2019ve always had incredible music to support their ideas. On <em>Shaking The Habitual</em> their abilities are on full display. In over one hour of music they go from their signature beat-driven electronica featuring Karin\u2019s instantly recognisable vocals to quite aggressive industrial-infused tracks to barely intelligible ambient that at low volumes might be confused with the sound of your actual ambience. Those mood swings are what makes this album so great. It is so omnivorous that you won\u2019t stop marvelling at Karin and Olof\u2019s abilities.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It\u2019s also kind of sad considering this was their final offering. Hopefully to date.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-spotify wp-block-embed-spotify wp-embed-aspect-21-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">\n<iframe title="Spotify Embed: Shaking The Habitual" style="border-radius: 12px" width="100%" height="352" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen allow="autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture" loading="lazy" src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/album/6GWQ6fq8krujlglglMPyPu?go=1&#038;sp_cid=4ee5ae78b0fe5b2a952220851425f3a8&#038;utm_source=oembed&#038;utm_medium=desktop"></iframe>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<iframe allow="autoplay *; encrypted-media *; fullscreen *; clipboard-write" frameborder="0" height="450" style="width:100%;max-width:660px;overflow:hidden;border-radius:10px;" sandbox="allow-forms allow-popups allow-same-origin allow-scripts allow-storage-access-by-user-activation allow-top-navigation-by-user-activation" src="https://embed.music.apple.com/us/album/shaking-the-habitual/1489761397"></iframe>\n',

        '\n<p>It\u2019s difficult to the point of impossible to make anything new or fresh in indie pop music. Feels like every single city in the world has at least a dozen aspiring teenagers who take up guitars and decide to go for 60s (or 00s) inspired songs. Not that there\u2019s anything wrong with that but it makes it incredibly hard to get your voice heard through all the noise.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But in the case of Superorganism it\u2019s hard to imagine how could they <em>not</em> be heard. Their music just brings so much fun and joy and it feels like everyone should listen to their debut.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The band initially started as a recording project with future members living in the United States, UK and Australia. Four of Superorganism\u2019s members were previously in a band, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Eversons">The Eversons</a>. While on tour in Japan, they met Orono Noguchi who became The Eversons\u2019 fan through YouTube recommendations. After the band discovered that Noguchi could sing, they sent her an instrumental and asked to record vocals over it. Noguchi then recorded her signature deadpan voice using her MacBook\u2019s microphone. The song was soon to become \u201cSomething For Your M.I.N.D.\u201d&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large post-content-image" id="yui_3_17_2_1_1705007724575_81"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="682" src="http://localhost:8888/wordpress-trunk/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Superorganism-Next-Big-Sound-1024x682.jpeg" alt="" class="wp-image-281" srcset="https://qfn.fuu.mybluehost.me/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Superorganism-Next-Big-Sound-1024x682.jpeg 1024w, https://qfn.fuu.mybluehost.me/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Superorganism-Next-Big-Sound-300x200.jpeg 300w, https://qfn.fuu.mybluehost.me/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Superorganism-Next-Big-Sound-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://qfn.fuu.mybluehost.me/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Superorganism-Next-Big-Sound.jpeg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><em>Super! \u00a9Next Big Sound</em></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2017 most of the band members moved in together and lived in a house in London. They turned the residence into a studio and produced and recorded their debut there. According to one of the band members, Harry: &#8220;We&#8217;ve got the guy making the videos downstairs, mixing in the other room, [and] singing going on [elsewhere], we&#8217;ve created this kind of warped version of a pop production house.\u201d&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Superorganism\u2019s output is rooted in the Internet culture and Noguchi\u2019s <a href="https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/superorganism-superorganism/">\u201cworld-weary\u201d vocals</a> deliver the lines in \u201cNobody Cares\u201d as if it were the anthem to modern culture. Noguchi admits that she was influenced by Pavement and Stephen Malkmus\u2019 delivery. Their music however goes well beyond wallowing in throwback. Even though there are certain touches from Beck, Daft Punk and James Blake, the sheer quirkiness is all their own. Almost every track on the album prominently features field recordings of various street sounds, opening corks, cars and a cash register. The fun part is that the band actually reproduce these sounds live. Watch their outstanding NPR performance below.\u00a0</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio embed-youtube"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">\n<iframe loading="lazy" title="Superorganism: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2K49QKVR0p0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Superorganism have a free approach to music that allows them to do pretty much anything they want mixing guitar songs with electronic base and adding all those 90s flavors. A perfect album for a lazy and sunny summer day.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-spotify wp-block-embed-spotify wp-embed-aspect-21-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">\n<iframe title="Spotify Embed: Superorganism" style="border-radius: 12px" width="100%" height="352" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen allow="autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture" loading="lazy" src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/album/15TFB6uLZlb3gnCysRrLix?go=1&#038;sp_cid=4ee5ae78b0fe5b2a952220851425f3a8&#038;utm_source=oembed&#038;utm_medium=desktop"></iframe>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<iframe allow="autoplay *; encrypted-media *; fullscreen *; clipboard-write" frameborder="0" height="450" style="width:100%;max-width:660px;overflow:hidden;border-radius:10px;" sandbox="allow-forms allow-popups allow-same-origin allow-scripts allow-storage-access-by-user-activation allow-top-navigation-by-user-activation" src="https://embed.music.apple.com/ca/album/superorganism/1316670136"></iframe>\n',

        '\n<p>Sonically, this album couldn\u2019t be any further from Nick Drake\u2019s <em>Bryter Layter</em>, which Boris reference with the cover. This fact is evident right from the start when we hear the guitars overdriven all the way to the red. But just as Nick Drake shows his immersive dedication to his folky <em>acoustic</em> guitar picking, so do Boris with Takeshi\u2019s Ibanez double-neck.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Fun fact: There are actually two other cover designs: <a href="https://www.discogs.com/Boris-Akuma-No-Uta/release/2557459">one</a> referencing Venom and a <a href="https://www.discogs.com/Boris-%E3%81%82%E3%81%8F%E3%81%BE%E3%81%AE%E3%81%86%E3%81%9F/release/1833993">super-minimalistic one</a> aka \u201cthe original\u201d. The \u201cBryter Layter\u201d version was deliberately extended to 39 minutes to match Nick Drake\u2019s album length exactly.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-full post-content-image" id="yui_3_17_2_1_1705007580780_81"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="555" height="597" src="http://localhost:8888/wordpress-trunk/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Boris.png" alt="" class="wp-image-275" srcset="https://qfn.fuu.mybluehost.me/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Boris.png 555w, https://qfn.fuu.mybluehost.me/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Boris-279x300.png 279w" sizes="(max-width: 555px) 100vw, 555px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><em>Well, Boris</em></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The album starts off with a lengthy noise track dubbed \u201cIntro\u201d. It borrows the riff from the title track that also acts as the albums closer. The track was later reworked for Boris\u2019 collaboration with Merzbow, <em>Gensho</em>. At over 9 minutes it is surely looooong but never boring \u2014 something that Boris somehow manage to do really well.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cIntro\u201d is followed by two ballsy, high energy tracks: \u201cIbitsu\u201d and \u201cFuri\u201d. These two were rightfully compared to Mot\u00f6rhead. They do share the dirty overdriven aesthetic. The difference is that Boris take the <em>overdriven</em> part to the extreme creating quite unintelligible rumble reaching its max towards the end of each track. And it sounds awesome!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A surprising plot twist is the 12 minute jam of \u201cNaki Yoku\u201d. The intro guitar riff is inspired by post-rock as well as 90s-00s emo with a hint of aforementioned Nick Drake. The track slowly develops into an already familiar noisy clipping jam with the guitars\u2019 sudden change owing more to late 60s-early 70s fuzzy prog and finally resolving into another overloaded swarm of unbridled energy.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-full post-content-image" id="yui_3_17_2_1_1705007580780_100"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1000" height="1000" src="http://localhost:8888/wordpress-trunk/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Boris-Akuma-No-Uta-2003-cover-original.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-276" srcset="https://qfn.fuu.mybluehost.me/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Boris-Akuma-No-Uta-2003-cover-original.jpg 1000w, https://qfn.fuu.mybluehost.me/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Boris-Akuma-No-Uta-2003-cover-original-300x300.jpg 300w, https://qfn.fuu.mybluehost.me/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Boris-Akuma-No-Uta-2003-cover-original-150x150.jpg 150w, https://qfn.fuu.mybluehost.me/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Boris-Akuma-No-Uta-2003-cover-original-768x768.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><em>The original cover was equally great</em></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Ano Onna no Onryo&#8221; is considered by some the only miss on the album but it is actually nothing like that. Sure, sandwiched between the 70s trip of \u201cNaki Yoku\u201d and the boiling pot of \u201cAkuma No Uta\u201d the track might get overlooked. But it is an outstanding jam rooted in Boris\u2019 inspirations.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The final track, \u201cAkuma No Uta\u201d is composed as a true star of the show. From the very first riff (previously referenced during the \u201cIntro\u201d) it is clear why the album shares the name with this track. Shortly after, the riff is joined by banging drums and it feels like your speakers are about to explode. At this point the track is still moving slowly creating tension and suspense. Two minutes into the track and we hear some faint scream and Boris unleash the full-on assault that only they\u2019re capable of. The levels are driven way into the red, the guitars are about to tear the amp\u2019s speakers, the drums bang like it\u2019s the end if the world and the bass sounds like it\u2019s Satan himself. The track ends abruptly and we dare you not to press play again!</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-4-3 wp-has-aspect-ratio embed-youtube"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">\n<iframe loading="lazy" title="Boris Akuma No Uta Live" width="500" height="375" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/261jBzTBtpE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Boris are no strangers to sudden stylistic changes. They have equally compelling work in a multitude of genres from noise rock to just noise to sludge/stoner to all of a sudden new wave. On <em>Akuma No Uta</em> they\u2019ve put many of those influences on one record. The album\u2019s stylistic range is refreshingly vast. From noisy drones to high-octane bangers to lengthy jams to thunderous eruptions of the title track \u2014 Boris surely cover <em>a lot </em>of ground here. No wonder this album made so many end of year lists and was praised by critics and fans. Boris would go on to achieve great deal of popularity with <em>Pink </em>(2005) including opening spot for Nine Inch Nails as well as soundtrack credit on <a href="https://oddboll.net/home/squrl-eps-1-3">Jim Jarmusch\u2019s</a> <em>The Limits Of Control</em>. But <em>Akuma No Uta</em> shows that their genius was already in full power.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-spotify wp-block-embed-spotify wp-embed-aspect-21-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">\n<iframe title="Spotify Embed: Akuma No Uta" style="border-radius: 12px" width="100%" height="352" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen allow="autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture" loading="lazy" src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/album/00oVPPcp3eor9x6VG2hvhy?go=1&#038;sp_cid=4ee5ae78b0fe5b2a952220851425f3a8&#038;utm_source=oembed&#038;utm_medium=desktop"></iframe>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<iframe allow="autoplay *; encrypted-media *; fullscreen *; clipboard-write" frameborder="0" height="450" style="width:100%;max-width:660px;overflow:hidden;border-radius:10px;" sandbox="allow-forms allow-popups allow-same-origin allow-scripts allow-storage-access-by-user-activation allow-top-navigation-by-user-activation" src="https://embed.music.apple.com/ca/album/akuma-no-uta/1476322111"></iframe>\n',

        '\n<p>Out of all indie/post-punk scene it\u2019s hard to find a more prolific and unusual band. Technically starting in the punk circles in 1976, The Fall never really associated with any style in particular. Through the years they underwent numerous lineup changes (there\u2019s a fucking huge <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_the_Fall_band_members">Wikipedia page</a> about all of them) and their music swung heavily from one side to another. The band was led by the iconic Mark E. Smith (RIP). His unusual delivery is instantly recognizable and sets The Fall apart from anybody else. It was <a href="https://archive.org/details/sexrevoltsgender00reyn">described</a> by critic Simon Reynolds as &#8220;a kind of Northern English magic realism that mixed industrial grime with the unearthly and uncanny, voiced through a unique, one-note delivery somewhere between amphetamine-spiked rant and alcohol-addled yarn.&#8221; One could argue Mark E. Smith <em>was</em> The Fall. At least this is how <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/jan/24/mark-e-smith-lead-singer-with-the-fall-dies-aged-60">he put it himself</a>: &#8220;If it&#8217;s me and your granny on bongos, it&#8217;s The Fall.\u201d<br>They never achieved commercial success but you could probably tell that from the music. Nevertheless, they achieved a strong cult following in the 80s and 90s.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-full post-content-image" id="yui_3_17_2_1_1705007379648_76"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="512" height="327" src="http://localhost:8888/wordpress-trunk/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/The-Fall.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-269" srcset="https://qfn.fuu.mybluehost.me/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/The-Fall.jpg 512w, https://qfn.fuu.mybluehost.me/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/The-Fall-300x192.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 512px) 100vw, 512px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><em>Mark is spitting his attitude on you</em></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><em>The Frenz Experiment</em> is their 10th studio album, released in 1988. By that time The Fall have achieved some chart success with their previous three albums and with their cover of the Northern Soul song, \u201cThere\u2019s A Ghost In My House\u201d. They were actually headed towards mainstream popularity.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Instead, they released <em>this</em>. Not that there is anything even remotely wrong with this album. It\u2019s incredible from start to finish. It\u2019s just that it\u2019s not particularly chart-friendly. It seems that at the time the expectation was that The Fall were going to unleash their magnum opus, an album that would cement them into the subconscious of the generations to come. Instead, they made an album that is very much The Fall. And that is the greatest part about this band. They managed to remain themselves and spit in the face of commercialism and whatever expectations the industry might\u2019ve had from them.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-full post-content-image" id="yui_3_17_2_1_1705007379648_95"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="539" height="607" src="http://localhost:8888/wordpress-trunk/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/The-Fall-.png" alt="" class="wp-image-270" srcset="https://qfn.fuu.mybluehost.me/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/The-Fall-.png 539w, https://qfn.fuu.mybluehost.me/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/The-Fall--266x300.png 266w" sizes="(max-width: 539px) 100vw, 539px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><em>Is that Art Garfunkel front row right?!</em></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Lyrically, the album is classic Mark E. Smith. The lyrics are witty, smart, sometimes funny and sometimes druggy and dark. &#8220;Bremen Nacht\u201d is a real-life tale of Smith feeling possessed by the victims of Nazism one night in Bremen. \u201cFrenz\u201d, \u201cSteak Place\u201d, \u201cCarry Bag Man\u201d and \u201cGet A Hotel\u201d are skeletal and quite minimalistic, and \u201cOswal Defense Lawyer\u201d is an American-flavored tale with Walt Whitman, Mark Twain, cut-out trial attendees and such.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Musically, The Fall\u2019s signature sound is on full display here. Tight and tense rhythm section, noisy and repetitive guitars and Smith\u2019s incomprehensible shouting. \u201cAthlete Cured\u201d features a gorgeous earworm of a baseline (even though it was lifted from <a href="https://youtu.be/SXHmWXPwol0">Spinal Tap</a>), \u201cFrenz\u201d is based around a repetitive guitar riff with chanting full of attitude and The Kinks\u2019 \u201cVictoria\u201d sounds like it was actually written by The Fall.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Often dismissed as inferior to the heavyweight trilogy that preceded <em>The Frenz Experiment</em>, it is nevertheless an incredible album that only confirms The Fall\u2019s genius.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-spotify wp-block-embed-spotify wp-embed-aspect-21-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">\n<iframe title="Spotify Embed: The Frenz Experiment" style="border-radius: 12px" width="100%" height="352" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen allow="autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture" loading="lazy" src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/album/3rirpZpS2CYSIxb37cRsMo?go=1&#038;sp_cid=4ee5ae78b0fe5b2a952220851425f3a8&#038;utm_source=oembed&#038;utm_medium=desktop"></iframe>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<iframe allow="autoplay *; encrypted-media *; fullscreen *; clipboard-write" frameborder="0" height="450" style="width:100%;max-width:660px;overflow:hidden;border-radius:10px;" sandbox="allow-forms allow-popups allow-same-origin allow-scripts allow-storage-access-by-user-activation allow-top-navigation-by-user-activation" src="https://embed.music.apple.com/ca/album/the-frenz-experiment/1028835314"></iframe>\n',

        '\n<p>d\u00e4lek are true unsung heroes of experimental hip hop. And in their case experimental goes far beyond quirky and offbeat music of the likes of <a href="https://oddboll.net/home/mf-doom-mmfood">MF Doom</a> or alternative hip hop of El-P. Their version of the genre mixes elements that are not often mixed with sampled beats and rapping such as shoegaze, industrial, krautrock and noise. Coupled with the beats that sound like the records were actually sprinkled with dust instead of wiping it off and scratches that is more reminiscent of rusty car breaks and you get the idea of what <em>From Filthy Tongue\u2026</em> is all about.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Listening to this album, it\u2019s not surprising that d\u00e4lek were signed to predominantly metal labels such as <strong>Ipecac</strong> and <strong>Profound Lore</strong>. They\u2019ve also shared the stage with the best of both hip hop and metal worlds: Isis, Godflesh, Earth, The Dillinger Escape Plan, De La Soul, RJD2, KRS-One and many more. It makes perfect sense as d\u00e4lek would be a perfect fit on both sides of the spectrum. Their music is sure to appeal to both hip hop heads and metal fans. Many publications tried to attached different labels to d\u00e4lek\u2019s output and quite honestly most of them are correct. Through the years they\u2019ve meddled with pretty much everything that is dark, noisy and experimental. No wonder they went on to collaborate with the German krautrock giants Faust on 2004\u2019s <em>Derbe Respect, Alder</em>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-full post-content-image" id="yui_3_17_2_1_1705007182668_76"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="693" height="411" src="http://localhost:8888/wordpress-trunk/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/dalek.png" alt="" class="wp-image-263" srcset="https://qfn.fuu.mybluehost.me/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/dalek.png 693w, https://qfn.fuu.mybluehost.me/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/dalek-300x178.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 693px) 100vw, 693px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><em>Coooool</em></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Here\u2019s what MC d\u00e4lek himself told Chicago Sun-Times about their music:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">\n<p><em>\u201cIt&#8217;s purely hip-hop, in the purest sense. If you listen to what hip-hop has historically been, it was all about digging in different crates and finding different sounds, and finding different influences to create. If Afrika Bambaataa wasn&#8217;t influenced by Kraftwerk, we wouldn&#8217;t have &#8216;Planet Rock.&#8217; So, in that sense, what we do is strictly hip-hop. If there is a difference. It&#8217;s that the palette of sounds we work with is more varied than what has been called hip-hop in the last 10 years. Somehow, as hip-hop grew, it&#8217;s been put into this box. I think it&#8217;s funny when people are like, &#8216;That&#8217;s not hip-hop. It&#8217;s this and this and this.&#8217; You can try to rationalize it as whatever you want to rationalize it as.\u201d</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Amen.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is utterly fascinating to watch d\u00e4lek push the boundaries to the extreme. \u201cBlack Smoke Rises\u201d has no beat and the noise that serves as the instrumental has hardly anything you could call a \u201chook\u201d. It\u2019s also 12 minutes long. Nevertheless, MC d\u00e4lek delivers his thoughtful and conscious rhymes over it as any 90s MC would over some polished production.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Lyrically, <em>From Filthy Tongue of Gods and Griots</em> is as dark, smart and conscious as any album in d\u00e4lek\u2019s collection. \u201cSpiritual Healing\u201d tackles the issues of race, \u201cBlack Smoke Rises\u201d sounds more like a twisted mantra with it\u2019s repeated refrain &#8220;Black smoke rises to a heaven I do not know/ Slowly gaze to take in our sorrow\u201d. \u201cForever Close My Eyes\u201d is painfully depressing as evident from the lines like &#8220;My yesterdays don&#8217;t matter now, they&#8217;re gone/ Your careless expression left my wrists torn&#8230;/ Yesterdays don&#8217;t matter now, you&#8217;re gone/ Shattered glass of empty bottles cut my palms.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>From Filthy Tongues of Gods and Griots </em>an astoundingly compelling work by extremely talented and forever underrated musicians. There is not a single sound or word that could\u2019ve been thrown away. It\u2019s a must have in any collection music geek\u2019s collection. 18 years after it still sounds like it was released yesterday.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-spotify wp-block-embed-spotify wp-embed-aspect-21-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">\n<iframe title="Spotify Embed: From Filthy Tongue of Gods and Griots" style="border-radius: 12px" width="100%" height="352" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen allow="autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture" loading="lazy" src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/album/4ZifLmCPfzhOCocXAMP9Ny?go=1&#038;sp_cid=4ee5ae78b0fe5b2a952220851425f3a8&#038;utm_source=oembed&#038;utm_medium=desktop"></iframe>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<iframe allow="autoplay *; encrypted-media *; fullscreen *; clipboard-write" frameborder="0" height="450" style="width:100%;max-width:660px;overflow:hidden;border-radius:10px;" sandbox="allow-forms allow-popups allow-same-origin allow-scripts allow-storage-access-by-user-activation allow-top-navigation-by-user-activation" src="https://embed.music.apple.com/ca/album/from-filthy-tongue-of-gods-and-griots/989431289"></iframe>\n',

        '\n<p>If this blog had a mascot it would definitely have lots of Tom Waits\u2019 features. The master of oddball has been a poster child for <em>different</em> kind of music for decades. In all honesty, any of his post-<em>Heartattack and Vine</em> albums could be reviewed here. We equally love <em>Rain Dogs</em>, <em>Swordfishtrombones</em> or <em>Mule Variations</em>. The only reason we picked <em>Bone Machine</em> is because we feel like it doesn\u2019t get enough attention in Waits\u2019 stellar catalog. That, and \u201cI Don\u2019t Wanna Grow Up\u201d.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When it comes to oddball and plain weird music with pop appeal it doesn\u2019t really get better than this. Tom Waits\u2019 already unusual voice reaches totally different heights. His haunted falsetto on \u201cDirt In The Ground\u201d is as existential as the lyrics itself. On \u201cWho Are You\u201d he offers his personal take on soulful while singing about scorn and jealousy. And of course his throat-tearing wail on \u201cI Don\u2019t Wanna Grow Up\u201d is an anthem and a lament for adolescence.\u00a0</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-4-3 wp-has-aspect-ratio embed-youtube"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">\n<iframe loading="lazy" title="Tom Waits - &quot;I Don&#039;t Wanna Grow Up&quot;" width="500" height="375" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/CWh4xHeFMIQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Lyrically, <em>Bone Machine</em> features Waits\u2019 familiar characters: restless strangers, lonely and broken people looking for a better life. He spent his whole career singing about a seedy underbelly of this world&nbsp; but also of the unpleasant darkness we all hide within. What is different about this album though is Waits\u2019 preoccupation with death. \u201cAnd the earth died screaming/While I lay dreaming of you\u201d he shouts on \u201cEarth Died Screaming\u201d. The song is follow by \u201cDirt In The Ground\u201d with a quite self-explanatory title. \u201cAll Stripped Down\u201d mentions Judgement Day. \u201cMurder In The Red Barn\u201d is about, well, murder. But the real beauty of <em>Bone Machine</em> is that it cannot be pigeonholed into just one color or emotion. \u201cA Little Rain\u201d is a beautiful song about risking it all and jumping into the search for a better future. \u201cWhistle Down The Wind\u201d has a strong country vibe with imagery of an idealized version of California (Waits\u2019 home state).&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Bone Machine</em> was produced and recorded at the Prairie Sun Recording studios. The room, (now referred to as \u201cthe Waits room\u201d) is an actual basement. According to Waits, there was just a cement floor and a water heater in it. The room is actually responsible for that signature echo featured on the album. The title is partially a reference to Waits\u2019 musical approach. His idea was to strip down the music to the most basic minimalistic and primal elements. \u201cEarth Died Screaming\u201d literally begins with sounds of a bunch of people banging some wooden boards.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-full post-content-image" id="yui_3_17_2_1_1705006989626_81"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="983" height="979" src="http://localhost:8888/wordpress-trunk/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Tom-Waits-1992-morrisonhotelgallery.com_.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-258" srcset="https://qfn.fuu.mybluehost.me/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Tom-Waits-1992-morrisonhotelgallery.com_.jpg 983w, https://qfn.fuu.mybluehost.me/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Tom-Waits-1992-morrisonhotelgallery.com_-300x300.jpg 300w, https://qfn.fuu.mybluehost.me/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Tom-Waits-1992-morrisonhotelgallery.com_-150x150.jpg 150w, https://qfn.fuu.mybluehost.me/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Tom-Waits-1992-morrisonhotelgallery.com_-768x765.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 983px) 100vw, 983px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><em>Pretty much how it looked like \u00a9 morrisonhotelgallery.com</em></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The list of musicians on <em>Bone Machine </em>is equal in its greatness to the music. But that is something to expect from a Tom Waits album. Les Clypool of Primus plays bass, David Hidalgo of Los Lobos plays violin and accordion, Larry Taylor, who played bass as a session musician for The Monkees and Jerry Lee Lewis is featured here on upright bass. And Keith Richards, Waits\u2019 long-time friend and collaborator plays guitar and does backing vocals on \u201cThat Feel\u201d and shares writing credits.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It\u2019s unfortunate, but not surprising that the album didn\u2019t sell too well only reaching No.176 on Billboard charts. But then doesn\u2019t it only confirm Waits\u2019 cult status? Despite that, the album gained stellar reviews from the critics. It even won a Grammy Award for the Best Alternative Album.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tom Waits\u2019 impeccable songwriting on <em>Bone Machine </em>is further confirmed by the amount of covers it produced. Ramones covered &#8220;I Don&#8217;t Wanna Grow Up&#8221;, Queens of the Stone Age did &#8220;Goin&#8217; Out West&#8221;, Squeeze covered &#8220;I Don&#8217;t Wanna Grow Up&#8221; again and even Scarlett Johansson recorded her versions of \u201cWho Are You\u201d and \u201cI Don\u2019t Wanna Grow Up\u201d for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anywhere_I_Lay_My_Head"><em>Anywhere I Lay My Head</em></a>, her Tom Waits tribute album.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Oh, and the cover photo was shot by Jesse Dylan, son of Bob.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-spotify wp-block-embed-spotify wp-embed-aspect-21-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">\n<iframe title="Spotify Embed: Bone Machine" style="border-radius: 12px" width="100%" height="352" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen allow="autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture" loading="lazy" src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/album/5blxyZRgkA735vO40p56MA?go=1&#038;sp_cid=4ee5ae78b0fe5b2a952220851425f3a8&#038;utm_source=oembed&#038;utm_medium=desktop"></iframe>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<iframe allow="autoplay *; encrypted-media *; fullscreen *; clipboard-write" frameborder="0" height="450" style="width:100%;max-width:660px;overflow:hidden;border-radius:10px;" sandbox="allow-forms allow-popups allow-same-origin allow-scripts allow-storage-access-by-user-activation allow-top-navigation-by-user-activation" src="https://embed.music.apple.com/us/album/bone-machine-2023-remaster/1695049294"></iframe>\n',

        '\n<p>It takes <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D%27Angelo">some artists</a> years to make an album. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_(musician)">Others</a> shell out hit records at the speed of light. There is no real answer to how long it <em>should</em> take to make a masterpiece. After all, some people like Manuel G\u00f6ttsching are able to improvise a game-changing record in as long as the record\u2019s actual running time. Well, minus the setting up time.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Manuel G\u00f6ttsching\u2019s name is probably familiar to those interested in <a href="https://oddboll.net/home/oddboll-spotlight-brain-records">krautrock</a>. By the time he started a solo career, G\u00f6ttsching already made an impact as the leader of highly influential Ash Ra Tempel (and subsequently, Ashra). Classically trained guitarist, he was inspired to switch to electric guitar after listening to Motown, The Rolling Stones and British blues bands on the radio (ran by allied forces). The first incarnation of Ash Ra Tempel actually played covers of The Beatles, The Rolling Stones, The Who etc. However, after hearing <a href="https://youtu.be/YXcYZsqkZ-g">Blue Cheer\u2019s cover of \u201cSummertime Blues\u201d</a> and discovering free jazz, the band moved towards a more free albeit blues-based approach. The band initially included <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Klaus_Schulze">Klaus Schulze</a> \u2014 a rival electronic pioneer and a highly influential figure in the Berlin school of electronic music.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large post-content-image" id="yui_3_17_2_1_1705006838892_72"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="542" src="http://localhost:8888/wordpress-trunk/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/manuel-gottsching-thevinylfactory.com_-1024x542.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-252" srcset="https://qfn.fuu.mybluehost.me/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/manuel-gottsching-thevinylfactory.com_-1024x542.jpg 1024w, https://qfn.fuu.mybluehost.me/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/manuel-gottsching-thevinylfactory.com_-300x159.jpg 300w, https://qfn.fuu.mybluehost.me/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/manuel-gottsching-thevinylfactory.com_-768x406.jpg 768w, https://qfn.fuu.mybluehost.me/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/manuel-gottsching-thevinylfactory.com_.jpg 1438w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><em>Something like that \u00a9 thevinylfactory.com</em></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>In 1971, G\u00f6ttsching released <em>Inventions for Electric </em>Guitar. Technically, the album was released under the Ash Ra Tempel name but it only featured G\u00f6ttsching on electric guitar and no other musicians or instruments (hence the title).&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In 1981, G\u00f6ttsching was on tour with Klaus Schulze. One evening, he was at his home studio and decided to record some stuff as an exercise and also make a tape to listen to on his Walkman during his flight to Hamburg the next day. So he hooked up his synths, fired up the sequencers, settled on a two-chord progression on his <a href="http://synthmuseum.com/sequ/seqpro1001.html">Prophet 10</a> and in one take, live, without overdubs made history.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-full post-content-image" id="yui_3_17_2_1_1705006838892_91"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="465" height="652" src="http://localhost:8888/wordpress-trunk/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/manuel-gottsching-dangerous-minds.com_.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-253" srcset="https://qfn.fuu.mybluehost.me/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/manuel-gottsching-dangerous-minds.com_.jpg 465w, https://qfn.fuu.mybluehost.me/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/manuel-gottsching-dangerous-minds.com_-214x300.jpg 214w" sizes="(max-width: 465px) 100vw, 465px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><em>The Wizard \u00a9 dangerousminds.com</em></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The music he made that night was so flawless that G\u00f6ttsching himself was struggling to understand how he was able to achieve it. In 1982 he was planning an album. Being an able and ambitious musician, he was looking to create a complicated and laborious piece of work. But he kept on coming back to that tape he made not so long ago. That music was just flawless. Not a single mistake.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So G\u00f6ttsching decided to release it as is. His first choice was Virgin, the label that released his previous work. He played the tape to Richard Brenson on his (Brenson\u2019s, of course) houseboat. Brenson liked the record and agreed to release it. But G\u00f6ttsching was not convinced. According to him, when Virgin released his early work, they were a much smaller label. He was afraid that his work will get lost among heaps of commercial music Virgin were releasing at the time. So he took the tape with him and didn\u2019t release the album until 1984.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>G\u00f6ttsching decided to go with the Inteam label and with a run of 1000 units. He didn\u2019t expect the album to sell well. Especially after one German publication called it \u201cmuzak\u201d and <em>Berlin Magazine</em> said that G\u00f6ttsching has not understood anything in the modern developments of electronic music and that he should better listen to Depeche Mode (the magazine apologized a decade later). G\u00f6ttsching was utterly shocked when he found out that American DJs were playing <em>E2-E4 </em>such as Larry Levan at Paradise Garage. The record went on to make further impact when it influenced the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ambient_techno">ambient techno</a> genre and was sampled by Black Dog, Carl Craig and The Orb.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>E2-E4</em> is truly magical. From the music itself that is dreamy and mesmerizing to the quite unbelievable origin story. <a href="https://classicalbumsundays.com/album-of-the-month-manuel-gottsching-e2-e4/">G\u00f6ttsching himself summarized it better than anyone else</a>: \u201cIt was just a perfect piece of music floating, and there weren\u2019t even any technical things. Usually during those sessions there\u2019s some point where there\u2019s a technical problem: something is too loud or too soft or something is crackling or a telephone ringing and you have to stop it. This was one hour where everything was perfect.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio embed-youtube"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">\n<iframe loading="lazy" title="Manuel G\u00f6ttsching \u2014 E2-E4 (1981/Full album)" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Vq-kovIr2BE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</div></figure>\n',

        '\n<p>Brian Eno has been making music for all kinds of spaces and places for decades, but what about music for <em>plants</em>? Sure, it might not seem so odd today when thanks to the Internet there is literally <em>everything for everything</em> but back in the 1970s celebrating plants was quite a novelty.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The story of this unusual album is actually three separate stories intertwined and begins with a similarly unusual shop: <em>Mother Earth Plant Boutique</em>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Joel Rapp and his wife Lynn opened the store on Melrose Avenue in Los Angeles back in 1970. In the following seven years they were <em>the</em> store for indoor plants and <a href="https://www.dazeddigital.com/music/article/44931/1/mort-garson-mother-earth-plantasia-reissue-history">according to Joel Rapp himself:</a> \u201c\u2026as far as celebrity clientele, there were very few celebrities who weren\u2019t customers. I had them all, I had them all.\u201d To understand its prominent status, it\u2019s important to understand that <em>Mother Earth Plant Boutique </em>arrived at a time when yoga, spirituality (especially the <em>different </em>kind of it), artists\u2019 communes, early vegetarianism and all those things that are a part of any major city nowadays were just starting to appear and the \u201chip\u201d crowd was jumping on it eagerly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Around the same time, in 1973, Peter Tompkins and Christopher Bird published <em>The Secret Life Of Plants</em>. In this best-selling book they claimed that plants could detect lies and were capable of telepathy and intergalactic communications (space age much?). They also claimed that plants actually enjoyed music and certain kinds of it would help plants grow faster and stronger. <em>The Secret Life Of Plants </em>was later developed into a documentary with <a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/3LSgLZrSXELqWt5eqb6XMY">a stellar soundtrack</a> by the one and only Stevie Wonder.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-full post-content-image" id="yui_3_17_2_1_1705006703300_76"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="800" height="400" src="http://localhost:8888/wordpress-trunk/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Mort-Garson-pitchfork.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-248" srcset="https://qfn.fuu.mybluehost.me/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Mort-Garson-pitchfork.jpg 800w, https://qfn.fuu.mybluehost.me/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Mort-Garson-pitchfork-300x150.jpg 300w, https://qfn.fuu.mybluehost.me/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Mort-Garson-pitchfork-768x384.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><em>It certainly made his wires grow \u00a9Pitchfork</em></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The final part of this story is the artist himself. Mort Garson was born in Saint John, New Brunswick, Canada in 1924 but raised in New York City. He started playing the piano at the age of 11 and went on to study at Juilliard School of Music. He began working as an arranger and pianist but was drafted to fight in World War II. After returning from the war he became an in-demand session player. Garson\u2019s main strength was that he could do anything: composer, arranger, orchestrator, conductor, pianist. In the 50s he began writing music for other people and by the mid-60s worked with all the big names of the easy-listening music of the time. In 1967, he attended the Audio Engineering Society&#8217;s West Coast convention where he met <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Moog">Robert Moog</a> himself. Garson obtained the massive Moog Modular system and was totally consumed with its possibilities. All of a sudden he didn\u2019t want to make pop music anymore. In 1969, he composed a piece that was played during the Apollo 11 moon walk. Despite Garson\u2019s work with high-profile acts his name remained largely unknown to the general public.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In 1976, inspired by the Peter Tompkins and Christopher Bird\u2019s claims regarding plants and music, Garson composed <em>Mother Earth\u2019s Plantasia </em>as a promotional item for <em>Mother Earth Plant Boutique</em>. The record came with a Mother Earth&#8217;s Indoor Plant Care Booklet by Lynn &amp; Joel Rapp. The album had a limited run at the time and was only available with a purchase of an in-house plant from <em>Mother Earth Plant Boutique</em> or a Simmons mattress from a Sears outlet (wut?).&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As many releases that we focus on here, <em>Mother Earth\u2019s Plantasia </em>remained relatively obscure for more than 40 years until the late 2000s. Around that time the record somehow resurfaced and was played by many DJs around the world. The songs were also gaining hundreds of thousands of plays on YouTube. In 2019 the record was reissued by the iconic New York label Sacred Bones (link). Their version actually comes with a download card embedded with wildflower seeds. There\u2019s also <a href="https://www.discogs.com/Mort-Garson-Mother-Earths-Plantasia/release/15915977">a version on green vinyl.</a> How cool is that?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Mother Earth\u2019s Plantasia </em>may not <em>actually</em> help your plants grow but its warm and soothing qualities are perfect for absolutely any occasion. The cozy interplay of the synthesizers is radically different from the robotic vision popularized by Kraftwerk around the same time. With its quirky sense of humor and Mort Garson\u2019s musical genius this record is destined to remain a favorite by almost everyone who\u2019ll give it a shot.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-spotify wp-block-embed-spotify wp-embed-aspect-21-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">\n<iframe title="Spotify Embed: Mother Earth&amp;apos;s Plantasia" style="border-radius: 12px" width="100%" height="352" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen allow="autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture" loading="lazy" src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/album/4Pj4zPHuEUPtfacdeTlqUG?go=1&#038;sp_cid=4ee5ae78b0fe5b2a952220851425f3a8&#038;utm_source=oembed&#038;utm_medium=desktop"></iframe>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<iframe allow="autoplay *; encrypted-media *; fullscreen *; clipboard-write" frameborder="0" height="450" style="width:100%;max-width:660px;overflow:hidden;border-radius:10px;" sandbox="allow-forms allow-popups allow-same-origin allow-scripts allow-storage-access-by-user-activation allow-top-navigation-by-user-activation" src="https://embed.music.apple.com/ca/album/mother-earths-plantasia/1454691596"></iframe>\n',

        '\n<p>How awesome would it be to just travel around the world and dig through endless crates of obscure music? Have you ever wondered how many exciting gems you\u2019ll find in there? Well, the British record label <a href="https://www.finderskeepersrecords.com/">Finders Keepers</a> did just that (not sure if they actually travelled anywhere but still) and they dug out this incredible lost gem.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Gen\u00e7lik \u0130le Elele </em>(means \u201cHand in Hand with Youth\u201d) is a debut studio album from Mustafa \u00d6zkent, Turkish musician, composer and arranger. As it sometimes goes, the record was largely unnoticed upon its release and remained obscure up until 2000s. In 2006 the aforementioned Finders Keepers found the album and reissued it for the rest of us to marvel. It blew up immediately becoming critical and commercial success. <em>Gen\u00e7lik \u0130le Elele </em>mixes psychedelia with funk, jazz rock and Turkish folk music to absolutely uncanny results. Every single track contains an amazing break and it\u2019s really surprising it hasn\u2019t been oversampled by now. But the artist himself seems to be more surprised that the record got any attention at all. Especially 40 years after its release.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-full post-content-image" id="yui_3_17_2_1_1705006523515_76"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="458" height="305" src="http://localhost:8888/wordpress-trunk/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Mustafa-Ozkent-theattic.net_.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-241" srcset="https://qfn.fuu.mybluehost.me/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Mustafa-Ozkent-theattic.net_.jpg 458w, https://qfn.fuu.mybluehost.me/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Mustafa-Ozkent-theattic.net_-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 458px) 100vw, 458px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><em>The man and the record \u00a9theattic.net</em></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Mustafa \u00d6zkent was born in Turkey, close to the Syrian border and grew up listening to a lot of Turkish traditional music through his parents. When he was still in school, the music teacher was looking for a certain singing voice so \u00d6zkent applied and eventually became this teacher\u2019s assistant. Shortly after he began learning violin and other instuments (both traditional and not so much). He cites Chicago, Blood, Sweat and Tears, Wether Report and George Benson as his early influences. Mustafa\u2019s career began in 1960 with the band called Teenagers (cuz they all actually were just teens in high school). By 1970 the young maverick became and in-demand session player in Turkey. He modified his \u201967 Fender Coronado by adding frets so he could play in quarter tones, similar to saz or lute. Eventually, Mustafa \u00d6zkent signed to <strong>Evren Records</strong> which was known for its audiophile recording techniques and overall high production standards.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In 1973 he recorded and released this gem with a hand-picked group of musicians at one of the Istanbul\u2019s best studios, <strong>Grafson</strong>. According to \u00d6zkent himself, the band were the best session players in Istanbul. According to Mustafa, they started recording at 12 pm and were completely done by 7 pm because they had to record everything in one take without overdubs and without multi-channel recording. So Mustafa had to adopt some microphone techniques to emulate stereo and to capture his psychedelic sound experimentation. He claims <em>Gen\u00e7lik \u0130le Elele </em>to be the first stereo record in Turkey.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Since the album was intentionally devoid of vocals, the label didn\u2019t release any singles and all the tracks were exclusive to the original and quite rare vinyl. As mentioned in <a href="https://www.finderskeepersrecords.com/shop/mustafa-ozkent-genclik-ile-elele/">Finders Keepers\u2019 Liner Notes</a> a huge amount of Turkish LPs at the time were taken off the shelves and recycled or destroyed due to oil shortages.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When the album didn\u2019t perform as well as expected, \u00d6zkent was disappointed and decided not to make a follow-up focusing on arrangement and production work instead. In 1975 he went to Netherlands on an invitation from a friend and ended up studying music at Academie D&#8217;e music D\u2019ixelles in Brussels, Belgium. In 1976 he travelled to Montreal for the Olympics as an arranger for a Dutch-Belgian big band. Due to internal tensions the band fell apart and \u00d6zkent returned to Turkey to work with a famous Turkish singer, Ajda Pekkan. In the following years he kept himself busy doing production and arrangements and working with a huge amount of artists.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-full post-content-image" id="yui_3_17_2_1_1705006523515_95"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="400" height="565" src="http://localhost:8888/wordpress-trunk/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Mustafa-Ozkent-idefix.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-242" srcset="https://qfn.fuu.mybluehost.me/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Mustafa-Ozkent-idefix.jpg 400w, https://qfn.fuu.mybluehost.me/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Mustafa-Ozkent-idefix-212x300.jpg 212w" sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><em>Probably from his yearbook \u00a9idefix</em></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>When in 2006 Mustafa \u00d6zkent got a call from Finders Keepers, he couldn\u2019t even remember what they were talking about. He also didn\u2019t have the master tapes, his label didn\u2019t exist for years and the label boss was already dead. He took his original copy of the album and made a master from that. According to \u00d6zkent, he spent a lot of time trying to get rid of all the noises but as a seasoned pro he did an absolutely fantastic job which is evident from all the subsequent reissues.&nbsp;The record became a phenomenon gaining rave reviews, impressive following and a staple among DJs worldwide. \u00d6zkent\u2019s music finally got its long overdue moment.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then a few years later he got another call this time from <strong>DJ soFa</strong>, who offered \u00d6zkent to play Europalia festival. Naturally, \u00d6zkent refused at first, stating that the band does not exist anymore and he doesn\u2019t really have the time. After being assured that there is a band for him who know and can play all the songs he agreed. So after more than 40 years he went on and played the album on stage during several dates in Europe with <strong>Bel\u00e7ika Orkestrasi</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-full post-content-image" id="yui_3_17_2_1_1705006523515_104"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="620" height="462" src="http://localhost:8888/wordpress-trunk/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Mustafa-Ozkent-Turkey-Tribune.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-243" srcset="https://qfn.fuu.mybluehost.me/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Mustafa-Ozkent-Turkey-Tribune.jpg 620w, https://qfn.fuu.mybluehost.me/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Mustafa-Ozkent-Turkey-Tribune-300x224.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 620px) 100vw, 620px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><em>Two drummers mean twice more fun! \u00a9Turkey Tribune</em></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The record is a great example of the so called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatolian_rock">Anatolian rock</a> movement and is a perfect slice of its time. Mustafa \u00d6zkent managed to add traditional undertones to his music while remaining \u201ccool\u201d and contemporary. You may not even notice the Turkish folk flavors at times especially when the frenetic drums and percussion come in. That is one of the aspects that make this record so unusual: it\u2019s definitely rooted in Western music of the time but Mustafa\u2019s traditional leanings produce completely unique kind of melodies that still sound refreshingly different almost 50 years after. It\u2019s a shame that it didn\u2019t get the attention it deserved upon its release but then since we cannot change the past why not enjoy this amazing record for what it is \u2014 an astonishing work by incredibly talented musicians.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-spotify wp-block-embed-spotify wp-embed-aspect-21-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">\n<iframe title="Spotify Embed: Mustafa \u00d6zkent Ve Orkestras\u0131 Gen\u00e7lik \u0130le El Ele" style="border-radius: 12px" width="100%" height="352" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen allow="autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture" loading="lazy" src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/album/3bnqPaNk1lbje5XwhZuPwz?go=1&#038;sp_cid=4ee5ae78b0fe5b2a952220851425f3a8&#038;utm_source=oembed&#038;utm_medium=desktop"></iframe>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<iframe allow="autoplay *; encrypted-media *; fullscreen *; clipboard-write" frameborder="0" height="450" style="width:100%;max-width:660px;overflow:hidden;border-radius:10px;" sandbox="allow-forms allow-popups allow-same-origin allow-scripts allow-storage-access-by-user-activation allow-top-navigation-by-user-activation" src="https://embed.music.apple.com/ca/album/mustafa-%C3%B6zkent-ve-orkestras%C4%B1-gen%C3%A7lik-i-le-el-ele/393643319"></iframe>\n',

        '\n<p>For any hardcore hip hop fan MF Doom needs no introduction. After all for the last 20+ years he constantly delivered album after album of outstanding shit under countless monikers and numerous collabs with such titans of the genre as Madlib, Ghostface Killah, Danger Mouse, Bishop Nehru and many more. <em>Mm\u2026food? </em>is his second album under the MF Doom moniker (god knows which one overall) and is sometimes considered his best.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The story of MF Doom is not particularly fun but it\u2019s a story of rebirth and dedication. Daniel Dumile formed his fist hip hop group KMD back in 1988 as Zen Love X with his younger brother DJ Subroc. They actually managed to get signed to Elektra Records and released an album that was a minor hit (but still a hit!) and garnered some MTV rotation. Right before the release of their second album, Black Bastards, Subroc was killed by a car when attempting to cross the Nassau Expressway. That same week Elektra dropped the band. The second album was shelved in part due to controversial cover art. Following these events, Dumile retreated from the hip hop scene from 1994 to 1997. He later described that period as being particularly dark, living nearly homeless and sleeping on benches.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In 1997 he started rapping at open mics in Manhattan while obscuring his face with a stocking at first. Soon he came up with the MF Doom moniker and began wearing his now famous mask inspired by Marvel Comics\u2019 character <em>Doctor Doom</em>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-full" id="yui_3_17_2_1_1705006331635_76"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="600" height="653" src="http://localhost:8888/wordpress-trunk/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/MF-Doom.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-237" srcset="https://qfn.fuu.mybluehost.me/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/MF-Doom.jpg 600w, https://qfn.fuu.mybluehost.me/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/MF-Doom-276x300.jpg 276w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><em>Cooooool\u2026</em></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Fast forward to 2004 and after the release of several acclaimed projects under various names (including the gorgeous <em>Take Me To Your Leader</em> as King Geedorah) MF Doom unveiled <em>MM\u2026food?</em> \u2014 a milestone in unusual, underground and quirky hip hop.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On <em>MM\u2026food? </em>Doom retains his sense of humor while delivering heavyweight rhymes on food-inspired tracks (obviously). The lyrics here are as clever as they\u2019ve ever been. Using food as a metaphor might seem cheesy (no pun intended?) but MF Doom works magic with the\u2026um\u2026medium and delivers steaming hot punches about edible rappers, cookies and beer.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>His signature sound collages consisting of cut up samples from movies, TV shows and whatnot are prominently featured here showcasing MF Doom\u2019s production and crate-digging skills.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That same year Doom released <em>Madvillainy</em> \u2014 his collab with Madlib, that propelled him to superstardom. But it\u2019s <em>MM\u2026food?</em> that truly showcases his abilities as both MC and producer. Absolute must for any music fan and the recent <a href="https://www.discogs.com/MF-Doom-MMFood/release/15724598">vinyl reissue</a> would make any record collector drool.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-spotify wp-block-embed-spotify wp-embed-aspect-21-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">\n<iframe title="Spotify Embed: MM..FOOD" style="border-radius: 12px" width="100%" height="352" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen allow="autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture" loading="lazy" src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/album/43yC4eriRHqTxGpb364KaR?go=1&#038;sp_cid=4ee5ae78b0fe5b2a952220851425f3a8&#038;utm_source=oembed&#038;utm_medium=desktop"></iframe>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<iframe allow="autoplay *; encrypted-media *; fullscreen *; clipboard-write" frameborder="0" height="450" style="width:100%;max-width:660px;overflow:hidden;border-radius:10px;" sandbox="allow-forms allow-popups allow-same-origin allow-scripts allow-storage-access-by-user-activation allow-top-navigation-by-user-activation" src="https://embed.music.apple.com/ca/album/mm-food/1516750770"></iframe>\n',

        '\n<p>This installment in Numero Group\u2019s <em>Wayfaring Strangers</em> series is an exquisite selection of privately pressed country from the early 70s.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But it\u2019s not <em>that</em> kind of country. The music compiled here mixes psychedelia with pedal steel. It is perhaps the perfect music equivalent of the famous <a href="https://i.pinimg.com/originals/d2/44/ba/d244bacb7ce121063f49ef110d66f39d.jpg">Gram Parsons\u2019 nudie suit</a>: it\u2019s technically country but with a druggy twist. GP\u2019s influence is actually all over the comp. His quote is on the hype sticker and it perfectly sums up his vision and the main idea behind the whole \u201cCosmic American Music\u201d thing: \u201cIt\u2019s basically a Southern soul group playing country and gospel-oriented music with a steel guitar\u201d.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>By the end of the 60s musicians were becoming weary of pushing the boundaries and exploring \u201cspace\u201d. So they turned their interest towards their \u201croots\u201d. Over the course of several years The Byrds, The Band, Dylan and Grateful Dead all began to implement simpler music forms and non-rock instruments. All those outdated banjos, fiddles and pedal steels suddenly were \u201cin\u201d again. Few years on and country-rock became a prominent force in music. Much to Parsons\u2019 disdain. He felt his ideas were misunderstood and called country-rock a \u201cplastic dry-fuck\u201d. We\u2019re going to save the debate about country-rock\u2019s merit for a later date and focus on the artists <em>Wayfaring Strangers\u2026 </em>highlights.&nbsp;Those early followers of Gram Parsons\u2019 vision were so inspired by him that they made all those great privately pressed recordings that the general folk totally forgotten about.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The best part of this compilation is that without major labels worrying about commercial viability and dictating the sound, these artists were virtually free to explore whatever the fuck they wanted. And it shows here big time. The general countryness is mixed with rock\u2019n\u2019roll, jazz-rock, psychedelia (duh) and sheer pure unconfined weirdness. Sometimes it\u2019s hard to believe that the songs were recorded almost 50 years ago (cheeeeeesy). Not only some of them would sound perfectly in place today but also the influence of that short period seems to be resonating with quite a few artists in 2020. All of those factors plus of course the obscurity factor are what make <em>Cosmic American Music</em> so appealing. If you\u2019re not a fan of country music this compilation would be a perfect way to ease in. And if you hate it so much you don\u2019t want anything to do with country, you\u2019ll still find this comp enjoyable.&nbsp;Promise.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And a bonus super random but super cool (in our opinion) fact: Don Dixon, the singer of the band Arrogance featured here actually produced R.E.M.\u2019s first two albums. Cool, huh?</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-spotify wp-block-embed-spotify wp-embed-aspect-21-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">\n<iframe title="Spotify Embed: Wayfaring Strangers: Cosmic American Music" style="border-radius: 12px" width="100%" height="352" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen allow="autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture" loading="lazy" src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/album/5uFF8Q8WlrvtK2WfK9VupC?go=1&#038;sp_cid=4ee5ae78b0fe5b2a952220851425f3a8&#038;utm_source=oembed&#038;utm_medium=desktop"></iframe>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<iframe allow="autoplay *; encrypted-media *; fullscreen *; clipboard-write" frameborder="0" height="450" style="width:100%;max-width:660px;overflow:hidden;border-radius:10px;" sandbox="allow-forms allow-popups allow-same-origin allow-scripts allow-storage-access-by-user-activation allow-top-navigation-by-user-activation" src="https://embed.music.apple.com/ca/album/wayfaring-strangers-cosmic-american-music/1085766331"></iframe>\n',

        '\n<p>German DJ and producer delivers one of the greatest electronic releases of the past decade. Based in Hamburg, Helena Hauff started making waves a few years ago. She hosted her own night, Birds and Other Instruments in Hamburg\u2019s The Golden Pudel club. In 2013 she released her debut EP, <em>Action Reactio</em> and has been continuously ascending ever since. Her recent <a href="https://shop.tresorberlin.com/index.php/kern005bundle.html">mix for Berlin\u2019s legendary Tresor club</a> confirms that she shows no signs of slowing down.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It feels great that an artist like Hauff gets all the recognition. Her sets scavenge dark and dirty corners of techno, industrial, electro and EBM. She knows how to throw in pure sonic grime and do that with taste. No wonder her set was named BBC Radio 1\u2019s Essential Mix of the year (the first female ever to earn the accolade).\u00a0</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio embed-youtube"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">\n<iframe loading="lazy" title="Helena Hauff Boiler Room x Dekmantel Festival DJ Set" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/OdJy_g1G7Ho?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>When putting <em>Qualm</em> on for the first time an unsuspecting listener might think that their speakers are busted. Even more so, during <a href="https://www.xlr8r.com/front-page/ask-the-experts-helena-hauff">a Q&amp;A session for XLR8R</a> Hauff herself admitted that once at a festival in Hamburg a guy screamed at her: \u201cCan\u2019t you hear how fucking shit all your bass drums sound?\u201d.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-full post-content-image" id="yui_3_17_2_1_1705005149849_81"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="725" height="483" src="http://localhost:8888/wordpress-trunk/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/helena-hauff-fact-magazine.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-224" srcset="https://qfn.fuu.mybluehost.me/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/helena-hauff-fact-magazine.jpg 725w, https://qfn.fuu.mybluehost.me/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/helena-hauff-fact-magazine-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 725px) 100vw, 725px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><em>Her kicks will kick the shit out of you \u00a9 FACT Magazine</em></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>But isn\u2019t \u201cshit\u201d the whole point though? It definitely is on <em>Qualm</em>. Every single one of the 12 tracks here is packed with overdriven overloaded analog magic. The album is indeed produced using only analog equipment. Actually just one synthesizer and one drum machine.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Musically, Helena Hauff hits all the right spots. <em>Qualm</em> mixes techno, acid, IDM, coldwave while adding distorted and twisted soundscapes. Despite pushing the levels into red, the album retains a certain \u201cpop\u201d appeal and sounds weirdly romantic at times. Some tracks (like the opener \u201cBarrow Boot Boys\u201d) consist of just the drum machine. Grimy kicks, claps and snares create a primal feel while not lacking anything at all. There\u2019s no melody here but who even needs it? The drums provide everything. <em>Qualm</em> channels primal music through a prism of various shades of dark and twisted. It\u2019s radical as it is mesmerizing.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-spotify wp-block-embed-spotify wp-embed-aspect-21-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">\n<iframe title="Spotify Embed: Qualm" style="border-radius: 12px" width="100%" height="352" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen allow="autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture" loading="lazy" src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/album/2hYmcjIinZoVCog5sP4k0H?go=1&#038;sp_cid=4ee5ae78b0fe5b2a952220851425f3a8&#038;utm_source=oembed&#038;utm_medium=desktop"></iframe>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<iframe allow="autoplay *; encrypted-media *; fullscreen *; clipboard-write" frameborder="0" height="450" style="width:100%;max-width:660px;overflow:hidden;border-radius:10px;" sandbox="allow-forms allow-popups allow-same-origin allow-scripts allow-storage-access-by-user-activation allow-top-navigation-by-user-activation" src="https://embed.music.apple.com/ca/album/qualm/1389701413"></iframe>\n',

        '\n<p>This is one of those perfect albums where every single note counts. The very first splashes of percussion (kinda reminiscent of Can\u2019s \u201cFuture Days\u201d) indicate something great to come and every single track on this album is simply amazing. It\u2019s an astonishing whirlwind of syncopated percussion, field recordings, some very deep bass and electronic touches. Oh and other sounds like splashes of water or neighing horses.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Released in 2014, <em>Tayi Bebba </em>immediately found its fanbase. Okay Africa named it one of the best albums of 2014, it was on <a href="http://bleep.com/">bleep.com</a>\u2019s \u201cEnd Of Year Roundup 2014\u201d and the track \u201cViarejo\u201d ended up on the Grand Theft Auto V soundtrack.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Clap! Clap! is an alias of Italian producer Digi G&#8217;Alessio who\u2019s also a long-time jazz musician. After releasing a handful of well-received EPs as Clap! Clap! in 2013-2014, he went all-in and released <em>Tayi Bebba</em>, a conceptual 17-track workout in African rhythms, UK bass, Chicago footwork, Hip-Hop and contemporary electronic music. The album moves between those styles seamlessly incorporating something new into each next track. \u201cHoly Cave\u201d mixes beautifully sung peaceful melody with some nice deep bass, \u201cAshiko\u201d progresses from 80s style groove into a destructive and menacing bass track and \u201cConqueror\u201d goes from tribal percussion to lush electronica to some more gorgeous bass production.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-full post-content-image" id="yui_3_17_2_1_1705004604364_76"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="575" height="435" src="http://localhost:8888/wordpress-trunk/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/clap-clap.jpeg" alt="" class="wp-image-219" srcset="https://qfn.fuu.mybluehost.me/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/clap-clap.jpeg 575w, https://qfn.fuu.mybluehost.me/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/clap-clap-300x227.jpeg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 575px) 100vw, 575px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><em>Those fields won\u2019t record themselves</em></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Tayi Bebba</em> also acts as a tour of an imaginary island with every next track marking a new location, ritual or event. All these from a coherent story of how Tayiians fought agains invaders. You can find full story <a href="http://www.tayibebba.com/">here</a> but just FYI the track \u201cBurbuka&#8221; stands for a blend made from the herbs of Jzimpo Mima and \u201cKwasi\u201d is the son of the legendary Opete and whose magic powers are linked to the four elements: earth, air, fire and water.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Each single track on this album is full of energy, life and space. <em>Tayi Bebba</em> was highly praised by Paul Simon, for whom Clap! Clap! produced three tracks on critically acclaimed <em>Stranger To Stranger</em>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This album covers so much musical ground that pretty much everyone can find something they like about it. 6 years after its release it sounds as fresh as ever.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-spotify wp-block-embed-spotify wp-embed-aspect-21-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">\n<iframe title="Spotify Embed: Tayi Bebba" style="border-radius: 12px" width="100%" height="352" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen allow="autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture" loading="lazy" src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/album/47GRUjIo1RbZNxFkNoPk9z?go=1&#038;sp_cid=4ee5ae78b0fe5b2a952220851425f3a8&#038;utm_source=oembed&#038;utm_medium=desktop"></iframe>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<iframe allow="autoplay *; encrypted-media *; fullscreen *; clipboard-write" frameborder="0" height="450" style="width:100%;max-width:660px;overflow:hidden;border-radius:10px;" sandbox="allow-forms allow-popups allow-same-origin allow-scripts allow-storage-access-by-user-activation allow-top-navigation-by-user-activation" src="https://embed.music.apple.com/ca/album/tayi-bebba/1518971120"></iframe>\n',

        '\n<p>It looks like Shuggie Otis had everything in place to become a star of enormous proportions. His father was R&amp;B pioneer Johnny Otis, with whom Shuggie played since he was 11 (he actually wore glasses and fake mustache to get into clubs where his dad played). He was a total musical prodigy and at the age of 15 played with Al Kooper on his <em>Kooper Session</em>. When Shuggie was 16 he played bass on Frank Zappa\u2019s monumental \u201cPeaches En Regalia\u201d (and Zappa wasn\u2019t fucking around when it came to musicians). He also played with Etta James, Bobby Bland and Eddie Vinson. B. B. King himself called Shuggie his \u201cfavorite new guitarist\u201d. Shuggie turned down The Rolling Stones who asked him to be Mick Taylor\u2019s replacement on the upcoming tour. Quincy Jones approached him offering to produce his album whom he turned down as well.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>By the time Shuggie Otis started working on <em>Inspiration Information</em>, his biggest success was the song \u201cStrawberry Letter 23\u201d which became a huge hit for The Brothers Johnson. Their version, produced by Quincy Jones, topped the Billboard R&amp;B chart, reached No.5 on the Hot 100 chart and performed very well in other charts.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-full post-content-image" id="yui_3_17_2_1_1705004498229_76"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="812" height="1024" src="http://localhost:8888/wordpress-trunk/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/shuggie-otis.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-215" srcset="https://qfn.fuu.mybluehost.me/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/shuggie-otis.jpg 812w, https://qfn.fuu.mybluehost.me/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/shuggie-otis-238x300.jpg 238w, https://qfn.fuu.mybluehost.me/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/shuggie-otis-768x969.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 812px) 100vw, 812px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><em>He\u2019s already better than you</em></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Inspiration Information</em> was his third solo album (and the last one for the next 44 years). Shuggie managed to piss off his label by taking three years to complete this record (and that during the time when artists would shell out record after record every next year or even more). But Shuggie knew what he was worth. For the first time he had full creative control over his music. With some lobbying from his father, Columbia build him a home studio. He wrote, produced and arranged all the tracks himself. He played most of the instruments on the album (excluding horns, strings and harp).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But <em>Inspiration Information</em> wasn\u2019t a success. It produced only one single, \u201cInspiration Information\u201d which saw a modest chart performance. Despite that Sly Stone was reportedly a fan.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The fact that Shuggie refused to tour with Stones and then work with Quincy Jones and then a few more artists actually came back to haunt him. After a series of such \u201crefusals\u201d he gained a reputation of \u201ctaking his time\u201d and his contract with Epic was nullified. For the remainder of the 70s his only credited work was as a session player on his father\u2019s, Johnny Otis\u2019 records.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Inspiration Information</em> resurfaced in the 90s. It gained a cult following in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rare_groove">rare groove</a> and acid jazz scenes. It also received praise from such musicians as Prince and Lenny Kravitz. Partially due to this regained interest, the album was reissued by David Byrne\u2019s Luaka Bop label in 2001. The reissue helped the album gain even more attention and it was reissued again in 2013 with an addition of <em>Wings Of Love</em>, an album comprising of unreleased material written between 1975 and 2000. Shuggie Otis than went on a well-received tour for the first time in four decades.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When listening to the album in 2020 its magic doesn&#8217;t seem to wane. The recent years saw an emergence of experimental soul/R&amp;B inspired music with Frank Ocean being the first descendent (even if indirect) of <em>Inspiration Information </em>who comes to mind. Shuggie is rooted in his musical background here yet his pioneering use of drum machines (namely Rhythm King) and unusual approach to composition take the music into rather space-like and psychedelic territory.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The album is a bold statement even if it turned out to be a career suicide. It\u2019s a statement of the artist who knew what he wanted and wasn\u2019t afraid to go for it. It may be miles away from <a href="https://oddboll.net/home/captain-beefheart-his-magic-band-trout-mask-replica"><em>Trout Mask Replica</em></a> but as a monument of artistic freedom and defiance they are very much alike.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-spotify wp-block-embed-spotify wp-embed-aspect-21-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">\n<iframe title="Spotify Embed: INSPIRATION INFORMATION" style="border-radius: 12px" width="100%" height="352" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen allow="autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture" loading="lazy" src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/album/5EvsfavFbWpzcg3VNLQEOF?go=1&#038;sp_cid=4ee5ae78b0fe5b2a952220851425f3a8&#038;utm_source=oembed&#038;utm_medium=desktop"></iframe>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<iframe allow="autoplay *; encrypted-media *; fullscreen *; clipboard-write" frameborder="0" height="450" style="width:100%;max-width:660px;overflow:hidden;border-radius:10px;" sandbox="allow-forms allow-popups allow-same-origin allow-scripts allow-storage-access-by-user-activation allow-top-navigation-by-user-activation" src="https://embed.music.apple.com/ca/album/inspiration-information/391950569"></iframe>\n',

        '\n<p>You may have never heard the name Brain Records or maybe even about krautrock but the influence of this label and this genre are so enormously vast that even Billboard charts in 2020 are peppered with music descendant from experiments of the krautrockers in the 70s. A lot of artists signed to Brain Records went on to become household names: Neu!, Cluster (Kluster), Popol Vuh, Harmonia, Birth Control and electronic pioneer Klaus Schultze. They even released Scorpions\u2019 debut album (before they were a harrrrrd rock(ing) band).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The story of Brain Records begins with another highly influential German label: Ohr. Ohr Records was founded in 1970 by Rolf-Ulrich Kaiser who was a pivotal figure in the development of krautrock. Kaiser\u2019s early interest was folk music. He wrote articles about it and even published a book on international folk music scene which included interviews with Joan Baez, Pete Seeger and others. In September 1968 he was the chief organizer of Internationale Essener Songtage (IES), one of the most important moments in contemporary German music. The event was one of the biggest festivals of popular music in Europe attended by 40,000 people with performances by about 150 artists, among whom were future powerhouses of German prog and krautrock:&nbsp; Amon D\u00fc\u00fcl, Floh de Cologne, Guru Guru, Soul Caravan (better known as Xhol Caravan) and Tangerine Dream. Frank Zappa also visited Germany for the first time with Mothers Of Invention. IES is regarded as the birth of independent German music.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After the success of the festival, Kaiser founded Ohr to release underground rock artists from Germany. The label became one of the most important music labels in the late 60s-70s rock music and released albums by such behemoths as Floh de Cologne, Tangerine Dream, Ash Ra Tempel, Klaus Schulze, Guru Guru, Amon D\u00fc\u00fcl, Embryo, Witth\u00fcser &amp; Westrupp, Birth Control, Hoelderlin and others.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In 1972 Kaiser and his wife visited Timothy Leary in his exile in Switzerland and under his influence became active proponents (and enthusiastic users) of LSD. Partly as a result of Kaiser&#8217;s increasing LSD \u201cexperiments\u201d and partly because of his management style, A&amp;R men Bruno Wendel and G\u00fcnter K\u00f6rber left Ohr in 1972 to found Brain Records. They brought Guru Guru with them from Ohr and immediately signed Cluster who soon recorded and released the incredibly influential <em>Cluster II</em>. The label quickly found success in Germany as well as much of Western Europe (although not so much in the US).</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-full" id="yui_3_17_2_1_1705003972101_129"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="600" height="423" src="http://localhost:8888/wordpress-trunk/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/A-350352-1342809460-2414.jpeg.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-211" srcset="https://qfn.fuu.mybluehost.me/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/A-350352-1342809460-2414.jpeg.jpg 600w, https://qfn.fuu.mybluehost.me/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/A-350352-1342809460-2414.jpeg-300x212.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><em>There\u2019s a caption already as well as copyright</em></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Throughout the 70s and early 80s the label signed and released music by so many seminal acts with such an enormous and long-lasting influence that it is sometimes hard to believe that all of <em>that</em> output was released by just one company. Neu!, Cluster, Harmonia, Klaus Schulze, Edgar Froese, Guru Guru, Grobschnitt, Novalis, Jane, Birth Control, Embryo, Popol Vuh, Curly Curve, Scorpions, Electric Sun, Accept and many many more saw their music released on Brain Records. The string of early releases on Brain featured green labels (talking \u2018bout vinyl here) and almost every single one of them is absolutely exceptional. It\u2019s a great indicator as to where to start with Brain Records: go to <a href="https://www.discogs.com/label/9261-Brain">Discogs</a>, check the release, if it has the green label \u2014 give it a shot as it will most likely be amazing.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Brain Records also licensed and released many amazing UK acts for the German market. Those include:&nbsp; Greenslade, Caravan, If, Spirogyra, Atomic Rooster, Alexis Korner, Gryphon and Steamhammer.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In 1976 G\u00fcnter K\u00f6rber left Brain to found his own label, Sky Records. The label is known for releasing much of Cluster and Cluster-related output as well as some other bands (such as Streetmark who are perhaps best known for their 1979 hit \u201cLovers\u201d) (link). K\u00f6rber\u2019s departure is marked the change of vinyl labels from green to orange.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is quite difficult to write about every single great release from Brain Records, so we will share an extremely subjective and a little bit random list of our favorites.&nbsp;<br></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Neu!, \u201cNeu!\u201d (1972)</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>These guys don\u2019t need any introduction and this album cover is arguably as iconic as <em>Dark Side Of The Moon</em> or <em>In The Court Of The Crimson King</em>. The album was recorded by the duo consisting of Michael Rother and Klaus Dinger in four nights. Fun fact: Rother and Dinger started in an early incarnation of Kraftwerk but have broken off to pursue their own thing. The opening track, \u201cHallogallo\u201d, is perhaps one of the most recognizable krautrock tracks. Its distinct drum beat was christened \u201cmotorik beat\u201d and serves as a template for drum patterns of the whole genre.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-spotify wp-block-embed-spotify wp-embed-aspect-21-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">\n<iframe title="Spotify Embed: Neu!" style="border-radius: 12px" width="100%" height="352" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen allow="autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture" loading="lazy" src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/album/77JnRHSaaS8D6JZQ4EIKu8?go=1&#038;sp_cid=4ee5ae78b0fe5b2a952220851425f3a8&#038;utm_source=oembed&#038;utm_medium=desktop"></iframe>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<iframe allow="autoplay *; encrypted-media *; fullscreen *; clipboard-write" frameborder="0" height="450" style="width:100%;max-width:660px;overflow:hidden;border-radius:10px;" sandbox="allow-forms allow-popups allow-same-origin allow-scripts allow-storage-access-by-user-activation allow-top-navigation-by-user-activation" src="https://embed.music.apple.com/us/album/neu/1538074924"></iframe>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Guru Guru, \u201cK\u00e4nguru\u201d (1972)</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another iconic release from the same year by another iconic band. Guru Guru released over 40 albums during their 50+ years career. This particular record deserves attention not only because it was released on Brain Records during its prime but also because it was released by the band\u2019s classic line-up. It consists of 4 lengthy (more than 10 min) mostly instrumental tracks. Guru Guru had roots in free jazz and it definitely shows here. Musically this album is sooo omnivorous raging from cosmic seemingly improvised explorations to straightforward rock with guitar solos and shit.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-spotify wp-block-embed-spotify wp-embed-aspect-21-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">\n<iframe title="Spotify Embed: K\u00e4nguru" style="border-radius: 12px" width="100%" height="352" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen allow="autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture" loading="lazy" src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/album/5fEwSGwhGXaUJKu5NDEfBL?go=1&#038;sp_cid=4ee5ae78b0fe5b2a952220851425f3a8&#038;utm_source=oembed&#038;utm_medium=desktop"></iframe>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<iframe allow="autoplay *; encrypted-media *; fullscreen *; clipboard-write" frameborder="0" height="450" style="width:100%;max-width:660px;overflow:hidden;border-radius:10px;" sandbox="allow-forms allow-popups allow-same-origin allow-scripts allow-storage-access-by-user-activation allow-top-navigation-by-user-activation" src="https://embed.music.apple.com/ca/album/k%C3%A4nguru-ep/1443275623"></iframe>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Eroc, \u201cEroc\u201d (1975)</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Eroc (born Joachim Heinz Ehrig) was the drummer and bandleader of the German band Grobschnitt (also released by Brain). Unlike other bands, they utilized humor in their music in the form of unexpected noises and silly lyrics and concepts. Their live performances included pyrotechnics and German comedic sketches. Eroc was also an innovative sound explorer and had developed his own methods of multi-tracking and phasing effects, with voices and instruments. His 1975 self-titled debut starts off as workout in early electronica but then develops into psychedelic rock-oriented takes and then into some absolutely out there avant-garde soundscapes. Astonishing and criminally overlooked album.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio embed-youtube"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">\n<iframe loading="lazy" title="Eroc \u2022 Kleine Eva (1975) Germany" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/epY819pACuI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Cluster, \u201cCluster II\u201d (1972)</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is the band\u2019s second effort (duh) and the first one as a duo. Conny Plank, the original member, left to concentrate on production. It is worth mentioning that he ended up producing Neu!\u2019s debut, Kraftwerk\u2019s \u201cAutobahn\u201d, Harmonia\u2019s \u201cDeluxe\u201d as well as Eurythmics and Ultravox.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Early on, Cluster were a very experimental, proto-industrial sounding outfit. With <em>Cluster II </em>they began their move to a more electronic sound. Also, this is the first of their albums where the tracks are actually named.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Cluster II </em>still retains the experimental tension and darkness of their early releases but takes them into more \u201caccessible\u201d territory. Just listen to this record and you\u2019ll be amazed at how many other artists drew their inspiration from it.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-spotify wp-block-embed-spotify wp-embed-aspect-21-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">\nhttps://open.spotify.com/album/1z02tw6fbqEsXDnBI1d6v9?go=1&#038;sp_cid=4ee5ae78b0fe5b2a952220851425f3a8&#038;utm_source=embed_player_p&#038;utm_medium=desktop\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<iframe allow="autoplay *; encrypted-media *; fullscreen *; clipboard-write" frameborder="0" height="450" style="width:100%;max-width:660px;overflow:hidden;border-radius:10px;" sandbox="allow-forms allow-popups allow-same-origin allow-scripts allow-storage-access-by-user-activation allow-top-navigation-by-user-activation" src="https://embed.music.apple.com/ca/album/cluster-ii/1443283071"></iframe>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Jane, \u201cTogether\u201d (1972)</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>This album is a perfect example of the more \u201crock\u201d oriented side of krautrock. This is an outstanding release (and the second album to be released by Brain after Scorpions\u2019 debut). Jane\u2019s sound on this record is more blues-oriented with swarms of Les Paul solos and Hammond organ textures. The band is sadly not really known outside of the limited circle of krautrock enthusiasts but the picture of the genre would be incomplete without them.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio embed-youtube"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">\n<iframe loading="lazy" title="JANE-Together-01-Daytime-{1972}" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/QlKnZaHs2YY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Klaus Schulze, \u201cBlackdance\u201d (1974)</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tribal, drone-y, operatic, ambient-y and unapologetically weird from the cover to the very last note. It is also notable because this release marks the point when the electronic pioneer and Brian Eno\u2019s main competitor used a \u201creal\u201d synthesizer for the first time. This record is a perfect example of electronic leanings of krautrock music and helps showcase just how rich and diverse the genre was. Fun fact: Klaus Schulz was the founding member of <em>both</em> Tangerine Dream and Ash Ra Tempel.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-spotify wp-block-embed-spotify wp-embed-aspect-21-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">\n<iframe title="Spotify Embed: Black Dance" style="border-radius: 12px" width="100%" height="352" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen allow="autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture" loading="lazy" src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/album/2bcTTySQbvkSVML7TWPDAv?go=1&#038;sp_cid=4ee5ae78b0fe5b2a952220851425f3a8&#038;utm_source=oembed&#038;utm_medium=desktop"></iframe>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<iframe allow="autoplay *; encrypted-media *; fullscreen *; clipboard-write" frameborder="0" height="450" style="width:100%;max-width:660px;overflow:hidden;border-radius:10px;" sandbox="allow-forms allow-popups allow-same-origin allow-scripts allow-storage-access-by-user-activation allow-top-navigation-by-user-activation" src="https://embed.music.apple.com/ca/album/black-dance/1443321512"></iframe>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Harmonia, \u201cMusik von Harmonia\u201d (1974)</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Harmonia was born when Michael Rother of Neu! approached Cluster in the rural German village of Forst asking them to be Neu!\u2019s backing band during their live shows. After the first trials the trio realized that there\u2019s something to it so Rother stayed in Forst with Cluster and they got to work on this masterpiece. It is hard to find an album that manages to capture the <em>idea </em>of krautrock so well. It\u2019s at the same time playful and murky, mechanical and organic, experimental and straightforward. Brian Eno called Harmonia \u201cworld\u2019s most important rock band\u201d and actually recorded with them in 1976. Their music was a big influence on David Bowie during his \u201cBerlin period\u201d. As described by Allmusic: \u201c[Harmonia are] one of the most legendary in the entire krautrock/kosmische scene.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-spotify wp-block-embed-spotify wp-embed-aspect-21-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">\n<iframe title="Spotify Embed: Musik von Harmonia" style="border-radius: 12px" width="100%" height="352" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen allow="autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture" loading="lazy" src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/album/5uPRvwQy9NmNMeEhgs99bW?go=1&#038;sp_cid=4ee5ae78b0fe5b2a952220851425f3a8&#038;utm_source=oembed&#038;utm_medium=desktop"></iframe>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<iframe allow="autoplay *; encrypted-media *; fullscreen *; clipboard-write" frameborder="0" height="450" style="width:100%;max-width:660px;overflow:hidden;border-radius:10px;" sandbox="allow-forms allow-popups allow-same-origin allow-scripts allow-storage-access-by-user-activation allow-top-navigation-by-user-activation" src="https://embed.music.apple.com/ca/album/musik-von-harmonia/1035400920"></iframe>\n\n\n\n<p>Also, find our very own playlist dedicated to Brain Records below.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-spotify wp-block-embed-spotify wp-embed-aspect-21-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">\n<iframe title="Spotify Embed: oddboll Playlist Vol.5: Brain Records" style="border-radius: 12px" width="100%" height="352" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen allow="autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture" loading="lazy" src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/playlist/60LzwL8YthWPE2HdoWuiQp?go=1&#038;sp_cid=4ee5ae78b0fe5b2a952220851425f3a8&#038;utm_source=oembed&#038;utm_medium=desktop"></iframe>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<iframe allow="autoplay *; encrypted-media *; fullscreen *; clipboard-write" frameborder="0" height="450" style="width:100%;max-width:660px;overflow:hidden;border-radius:10px;" sandbox="allow-forms allow-popups allow-same-origin allow-scripts allow-storage-access-by-user-activation allow-top-navigation-by-user-activation" src="https://embed.music.apple.com/ca/playlist/oddboll-playlist-vol-5-brain-records/pl.u-4JomgDltG4vxgy"></iframe>\n\n\n\n<p>A playlist featuring NEU!, Cluster, Harmonia, and others</p>\n',

    content: {
      rendered:
        '\n<p>I still remember how a friend of mine showed me the video for \u201cLust for Life\u201d (the NSFW version) and I just could not believe my eyes. Not only was the song a rapid two-minute embodiment of everything I was looking for in music at the time but it also perfectly captured the life I was living when I was 16. To this day when I hear the neurotic strumming of \u201cLust for Life\u201d it makes me wanna jump on my bed with a bong in one hand and a bottle of vodka in the other.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The music throughout the album is heavily soaked with nostalgia. You get fashionable indie rock, folk, 50s girl group drum beats, lo-fi dirt and god knows what else. The production is supposed to be lo-fi and you can hear some production artifacts but all the soft pillowy dirt only adds to the album\u2019s glory. The band was compared to Beach Boys too many times but rightfully so. Girls do have the same bright sunny colors that early Beach Boys had.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-full post-content-image" id="yui_3_17_2_1_1705003561736_72"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="960" height="540" src="http://localhost:8888/wordpress-trunk/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/girls.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-199" srcset="https://qfn.fuu.mybluehost.me/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/girls.jpg 960w, https://qfn.fuu.mybluehost.me/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/girls-300x169.jpg 300w, https://qfn.fuu.mybluehost.me/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/girls-768x432.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><em>Boys \u00a9StyleCaster</em></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The story behind the band is pretty sad though. The lead singer Christopher Owens was born in the Children of God cult, his older brother died of pneumonia because the cult didn\u2019t believe in medical help, his father left, and his mom was forced to do sex work. And even though the songs on the album are mostly pop takes on girls and breakups, Owens\u2019 voice has some quality of a damaged person to it. Maybe it\u2019s far-fetched but it\u2019s quite fitting to believe that it isn\u2019t.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At the time of its release the album was praised by almost everyone. Some of the album\u2019s numbers may sound outdated today but it\u2019s only because we grew weary of jangling sunshine chords of 00s indie. There is nothing <em>actually</em> outdated about the music and it won\u2019t reach its expiration date any time soon. It is still great for parties, campfires or lonely nights after a breakup.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It\u2019s been 11 years since the album\u2019s release and \u201cMorning Light\u201d and \u201cLust for Life\u201d are still in my favorite music playlists. I would occasionally turn the volume up on \u201cLust for Life\u201d when getting ready for a party and even in the middle of winter the song would make everything sunny and warm.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-spotify wp-block-embed-spotify wp-embed-aspect-21-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">\n<iframe title="Spotify Embed: Album" style="border-radius: 12px" width="100%" height="352" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen allow="autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture" loading="lazy" src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/album/2d2nOfrJxU2Wpzc1AAZewC?go=1&#038;sp_cid=4ee5ae78b0fe5b2a952220851425f3a8&#038;utm_source=oembed&#038;utm_medium=desktop"></iframe>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<iframe allow="autoplay *; encrypted-media *; fullscreen *; clipboard-write" frameborder="0" height="450" style="width:100%;max-width:660px;overflow:hidden;border-radius:10px;" sandbox="allow-forms allow-popups allow-same-origin allow-scripts allow-storage-access-by-user-activation allow-top-navigation-by-user-activation" src="https://embed.music.apple.com/us/album/album/1699649591"></iframe>\n',

        '\n<p>DakhaBrakha are perhaps one of the most well-known and acclaimed bands to come out of Ukraine in the recent years. They are playing sold out shows around the world, made appearances at Glastonbury, Bonnaroo, KEXP, \u201cLater\u2026with Jools Holland\u201d (the only Ukrainian band to ever appear on the show) and even have an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsNKSbTNd5I">NPR Tiny Desk concert</a> behind their belt. Their music also appeared in media such as season 3 of \u201cFargo\u201d.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And rightfully so, because their output is unlike anything else. DakhaBrakha call their music \u201cethnic chaos\u201d and it contains elements of world music from pretty much every sonic corner of the Earth with Ukrainian traditional music flavors added to the mix. Their songs can go from happy, upbeat and quite danceable to abstract, drone-y, experimental and tense. They also play a vast range of instruments such as darbuka, tabla, didjeridoo, accordion, trombone, djembe, bugay, zgaleyka, piano, cello and many many more. But the most prominent part of their music is perhaps the vocals. Rooted in traditional Ukrainian singing <a href="https://www.polyphonyproject.com/en/our-picks">(which is an absolutely stunning art form in its own)</a>, DakhaBrakha add lots of various influences ranging from rapping to screaming.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The band was formed in 2004 at the Kyiv Center of Contemporary Art \u00abDAKH\u00bb by the avant-garde theatre director \u2014 Vladyslav Troitskyi. At first they were making music for Troitsky\u2019s plays but shortly proved to be a fully formed act of their own. Their strong ties to the theatre show in their performances that are quite unusual and transcendental events.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large post-content-image" id="yui_3_17_2_1_1705003455726_76"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="512" src="http://localhost:8888/wordpress-trunk/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/dahabraha-karabas.live_-1024x512.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-195" srcset="https://qfn.fuu.mybluehost.me/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/dahabraha-karabas.live_-1024x512.jpg 1024w, https://qfn.fuu.mybluehost.me/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/dahabraha-karabas.live_-300x150.jpg 300w, https://qfn.fuu.mybluehost.me/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/dahabraha-karabas.live_-768x384.jpg 768w, https://qfn.fuu.mybluehost.me/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/dahabraha-karabas.live_.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><em>Look at those hats! \u00a9karabas.live</em></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cLight\u201d is a perfect embodiment of everything DakhaBrakha stand for. \u201cSukhyi Dub\u201d (pronounced soo-khii doob (not <em>that</em> doob, you little stoner) is a moody take combining elements of dark cabaret with an amazing cello riff and a spoken word story about a squeezebox player. \u201cSpecially For You\u201d sounds like James Blake with live instruments and heavily on acid. \u201cKarpatskyi Rep\u201d (means \u201cCarpathian Rap\u201d) is a rather unusual take on rapping. \u201cZhaba\u201d (means \u201cfrog\u201d) is shiny and upbeat and must be the fastest track on the album. \u201cTjolky\u201d (means \u201cheifer\u201d but also a not-too-nice way to refer to a young woman) features synths, drum machines and overdriven bass guitar and some more \u201crapping\u201d. \u201cKolyskova\u201d (means \u201clullaby\u201d) is a much calmer number with astonishing melodies and gorgeous singing. \u201cBaby\u201d is perhaps DakhaBrakha\u2019s biggest hit and also their most \u201cwestern\u201d-sounding song. It is less experimental and out there than some of their other tracks and features an electric guitar (for a change) and probably one of the greatest cello riffs of all time. The English lyrics simply repeat \u201cBaby, show me your love\u2026\u201d over and over while the female vocal part is a mishmash of various regional dialects as well as Russian and Ukrainian languages. \u201cBaby\u201d is as hypnotic as it is stunningly beautiful and it gets better and better with every next note you hear. \u201cPlease Don\u2019t Cry\u201d is another dark track on the album with choruses being closer to a Sisters Of Mercy song with noisy guitars, intense piano and vocals drowned in reverb. \u201cBuvaite Zdorovi\u201d (a form of goodbye in Ukrainian which literally means \u201cbe healthy\u201d) is chilling and hypnotic closer.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After that we dare you not to play this album again. And then their whole discography. And then repeat.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-spotify wp-block-embed-spotify wp-embed-aspect-21-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">\n<iframe title="Spotify Embed: Light" style="border-radius: 12px" width="100%" height="352" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen allow="autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture" loading="lazy" src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/album/3ZtpOPSQuN6hOtAlyBJqFT?go=1&#038;sp_cid=4ee5ae78b0fe5b2a952220851425f3a8&#038;utm_source=oembed&#038;utm_medium=desktop"></iframe>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<iframe allow="autoplay *; encrypted-media *; fullscreen *; clipboard-write" frameborder="0" height="450" style="width:100%;max-width:660px;overflow:hidden;border-radius:10px;" sandbox="allow-forms allow-popups allow-same-origin allow-scripts allow-storage-access-by-user-activation allow-top-navigation-by-user-activation" src="https://embed.music.apple.com/ca/album/light/804795918"></iframe>\n',

        '\n<p>Even though I was raised on metal music, by the age of 19 I kind of fell out of touch with it and heavy stuff was of no interest to me. Without exaggeration this album singlehandedly changed my preferences and listening habits.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When I was about 13 years old there was a magazine in Ukraine called X3M (pronounced \u201cextreme\u201d). The magazine focused on everything related to youth culture of the era: from skateboarding (and snowboarding) to graffiti, urban travel to the most fucked up places in the country and of course music. In one of the issues there was an article about sludge music. I had no idea what it was and never heard of any of the bands before. I didn\u2019t care enough to actually give it a listen (bc I was a little snob, convinced that I already knew everything I needed to about music). But the point that sludge music is dirty af stuck in my head.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Years passed, the article was ultimately forgotten. Until one day, when I was roaming through wild terrains of underground music blogs I found perhaps one of the smallest and the most elitist of them all. Of course I wanted to seem cool to the blog\u2019s crowd so I embarked on a journey of listening to their whole archive. Scrolling through their pages I\u2019ve stumbled upon a cover of some forest creature with a bong. Under the \u201cgenre\u201d section it was written: \u201csludge/doom\u201d. Surprisingly enough I remembered the article from my innocent years and this time decided to give it&nbsp; a shot.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large post-content-image" id="yui_3_17_2_1_1705003321986_76"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="568" src="http://localhost:8888/wordpress-trunk/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Electric-Wizrd-1024x568.jpeg" alt="" class="wp-image-191" srcset="https://qfn.fuu.mybluehost.me/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Electric-Wizrd-1024x568.jpeg 1024w, https://qfn.fuu.mybluehost.me/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Electric-Wizrd-300x166.jpeg 300w, https://qfn.fuu.mybluehost.me/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Electric-Wizrd-768x426.jpeg 768w, https://qfn.fuu.mybluehost.me/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Electric-Wizrd.jpeg 1500w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">eEW!!! \u00a9Stub Hub</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The moment I put \u201cDopethrone\u201d on my life changed for real. I realized how wrong I was and lamented all these years of ignorance. I never knew that you can play that slow and dirty, I just didn\u2019t know metal could do that! From the very first drum and bass interplay on \u201cVinum Sabbathi\u201d you feel as if stepping into a swamp that will slowly consume you whole and you may or may not come back the same. Once you\u2019ve put it on you hardly notice anything around you as the album develops into long passages of pure guitar filth. Jus Oborn, the lead singer and guitarist for the band remembered in an interview with Kerrang! that their goal was to create the most foul and disgusting record. And they did! On <a href="http://last.fm/">last.fm</a> one of the tags actually reads \u201cheavy as fuck\u201d. Can\u2019t disagree. Even listening to the album sober you feel like you\u2019re on drugs, the music is just soaked, man!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are absolutely zero fillers on the album which is quite an achievement for a 76 min record. With all its dirt, anger and the atmosphere of a rock bottom you just don\u2019t want the music to stop. The moment you step in, you are doomed (no pun intended) to drop whatever it is you are doing and just eagerly listen to every drop of mud Electric Wizard are throwing at you. And they won\u2019t let you go until you realize that the last track\u2019s been over for a while and you\u2019ve been blankly staring at the ceiling. \u201cDopethrone\u201d is true magic. Black magic, if you wish.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Even if you\u2019re not a fan of heavy music, \u201cDopethrone\u201d will still be a captivating experience. It\u2019s metal but it\u2019s unlike anything you could imagine.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It\u2019s been years since I heard it for the first time and I listened to it on repeat and even bought a reissue on gorgeous sparkling gold vinyl but its power doesn\u2019t seem to wane. Not even a bit.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-spotify wp-block-embed-spotify wp-embed-aspect-21-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">\n<iframe title="Spotify Embed: Dopethrone" style="border-radius: 12px" width="100%" height="352" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen allow="autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture" loading="lazy" src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/album/1AxwLCMtx8rnIxkFQKU2LO?go=1&#038;sp_cid=4ee5ae78b0fe5b2a952220851425f3a8&#038;utm_source=oembed&#038;utm_medium=desktop"></iframe>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<iframe allow="autoplay *; encrypted-media *; fullscreen *; clipboard-write" frameborder="0" height="450" style="width:100%;max-width:660px;overflow:hidden;border-radius:10px;" sandbox="allow-forms allow-popups allow-same-origin allow-scripts allow-storage-access-by-user-activation allow-top-navigation-by-user-activation" src="https://embed.music.apple.com/ca/album/dopethrone/965381927"></iframe>\n',

        '\n<p>\u201cSuper \u00e6\u201d is a fun album. It\u2019s like a rollercoaster. But the one where you can\u2019t ever predict what\u2019s coming up next. The very first track, \u201cSuper You\u201d even <em>sounds</em> like a rollercoaster! From the very first notes you can tell that\u2019s it\u2019s gonna be a headspinning ride.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cSuper \u00e6\u201d marks a change in Boredoms\u2019 image and general attitude. Formed in 1986 by Yamataka Eye aka Yamatsuka Eye aka Yamantaka Eye aka Yamataka Eye aka eYe or EY\u30e8 aka DJ \u5149\u5149\u5149 (DJ pica pica pica) with another almost constant member Yoshimi P-We, they dedicated their first years of existence to being a rather extreme, abrasive and abusive band. Their approach was so nihilistic, some even said that it was &#8220;pointlessly abrasive\u201d and even called it <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absolute_music">\u201cabsolute music\u201d</a>. However it\u2019s their no-nonsense approach and willingness to go as far as they want are what earned them their first seeds of popularity. In the late 80s, Eye became friends with Sonic Youth and contributed to John Zorn\u2019s Naked City project as a guest vocalist. After the release of Boredoms\u2019 \u201cSould Discharge\u201d album, the band managed to get signed to Warner\u2019s imprint, Reprise Records. Their next release, \u201cPop Tatari\u201d is considered to be one of the strangest releases on a major label. Following their sudden growth in popularity, Boredoms toured with Sonic Youth, Brutal Truth and Nirvana (yeah, THAT Nirvana) in the early 90s. In 1994 they performed on the main stage of Lollapalooza (yeah, THAT Lollapalooza) which was again highly unusual for such a weird band. Nevertheless, they were eventually dropped from the Reprise roster.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large post-content-image" id="yui_3_17_2_1_1705003246810_71"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="576" src="http://localhost:8888/wordpress-trunk/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Boredoms-ontheaside.com_-1024x576.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-187" srcset="https://qfn.fuu.mybluehost.me/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Boredoms-ontheaside.com_-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://qfn.fuu.mybluehost.me/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Boredoms-ontheaside.com_-300x169.jpg 300w, https://qfn.fuu.mybluehost.me/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Boredoms-ontheaside.com_-768x432.jpg 768w, https://qfn.fuu.mybluehost.me/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Boredoms-ontheaside.com_-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://qfn.fuu.mybluehost.me/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Boredoms-ontheaside.com_.jpg 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><em>Looks like it sounds \u00a9ontheaside.com</em></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>By 1998 their sound began to change. They became less noisy and more electronic-y and psychedelic with comparisons to Can becoming prevalent. The music was named &#8220;tumultuous space-sludge\u201d and some YouTube commenters pointed out how it is a \u201csonic equivalent of a cactus\u201d. The album was met with widespread critical acclaim. Most notably from Pitchfork, who placed it at #44 on their <a href="https://pitchfork.com/features/lists-and-guides/5923-top-100-albums-of-the-1990s/?page=6">\u201cBest Of 1990s\u201d list</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cSuper \u00e6\u201d is indeed among the best records out there and it\u2019s a shame it isn\u2019t a household name.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The opening riff of \u201cSuper You\u201d sorta foreshadows the epic and odd scale of the record to come. It goes on and on and on and then there are some spinning-like tape effects and then it mellows down into beautiful soundscapes of \u201cSuper Are\u201d intro only to be dismantled by tribal drumming. And after that you don\u2019t know where you are anymore and what is this record anyway. \u201cSuper Going\u201d is a prog- and krautrock workout stretching for 12 minutes. But the music is so uplifting and powerful that it makes you wanna stretch these 12 minutes for another 12 years and make it a soundtrack to your life.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cSuper Coming\u201d is the closest this album comes to a conventional song. But even then it sounds like a caveman played all the instruments. \u201cSuper Are You\u201d is an irresistible punk-flavored take that evolves into some monk-like chanting with random drumming and deep synths. \u201cSuper Shine\u201d features amazing repetitive vocal patterns that make you feel like one of those snakes charmed by a flute. And after all that kaleidoscope of gorgeous noisy music the album arrives at \u201cSuper Good\u201d: an incredibly beautiful track that serves as a comedown after a prolonged trip.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And, as mentioned by another YouTube commenter: its title is also a great review of this album. Everything about it is just \u201csuper\u201d.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio embed-youtube"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">\n<iframe loading="lazy" title="Boredoms - Super \u00e6 (Full Album)" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fUSGujidgns?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</div></figure>\n',

        '\n<p>Even without the backstory \u201cThe Disintegration Loops\u201d is a compelling and satisfying listen. The melancholic and detached sounds that slowly decay overtime evoke the very essence of burning melancholy they were meant to. But it\u2019s the backstory that turns this great album into a masterpiece.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-full post-content-image" id="yui_3_17_2_1_1705002925398_76"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="750" height="450" src="http://localhost:8888/wordpress-trunk/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/basinski.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-180" srcset="https://qfn.fuu.mybluehost.me/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/basinski.jpg 750w, https://qfn.fuu.mybluehost.me/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/basinski-300x180.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><em><s>Mickey Rourke</s></em> \u00a9Shakti Music</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The record started out back in 1982 as recordings of found sound sources, shortwave radio and delay systems. Years later, as Basinski decided to transfer the records onto digital carriers he noticed that the tape deteriorated over time and each time it played it would lose some ferrite thus losing fidelity. The resulting music gradually goes from something to nothing literally disintegrating in front of the listener.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Basisnki finished the project the morning of the 9/11 attacks and sat on the roof of his apartment building watching the towers collapse. He made a video that day and used the stills from it as cover art. The next morning he played the \u201cDisintegration Loop 1.1\u201d as a soundtrack to the aftermath.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It\u2019s hard to find anything that would express the horrible event as powerfully as this music does. The deterioration of the tape creates a sense of existential despair. Basinski is using much more than the sound itself to create a piece of art. The music transcends mere entertainment into a statement. It\u2019s our own disintegration showing through the quiet crackling.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-spotify wp-block-embed-spotify wp-embed-aspect-21-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">\n<iframe title="Spotify Embed: The Disintegration Loops (Remastered)" style="border-radius: 12px" width="100%" height="352" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen allow="autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture" loading="lazy" src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/album/1xVP4eFcagXNtQMvEXfyeV?go=1&#038;sp_cid=4ee5ae78b0fe5b2a952220851425f3a8&#038;utm_source=oembed&#038;utm_medium=desktop"></iframe>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<iframe allow="autoplay *; encrypted-media *; fullscreen *; clipboard-write" frameborder="0" height="450" style="width:100%;max-width:660px;overflow:hidden;border-radius:10px;" sandbox="allow-forms allow-popups allow-same-origin allow-scripts allow-storage-access-by-user-activation allow-top-navigation-by-user-activation" src="https://embed.music.apple.com/ca/album/the-disintegration-loops-remastered/908005350"></iframe>\n',

        '\n<p>Calling this album \u201ca comprehensive guide\u201d is no mere exaggeration: with 49 tracks divided into 7 discs, 7 tracks each (hence \u201c7G\u201d) this record covers A LOT of ground.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Conceptually, each disc is dedicated to a separate instrument: <em>Drums, Guitar, </em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roland_JP-8000#Supersaw"><em>Supersaw</em></a><em> </em>(sound of multiple detuned sawtooth oscillators),<em> Piano, Nord, Spoken Word </em>and <em>Extreme Vocals</em>. Over the course of 49 tracks, A.G. Cook also covers Blur, Charli XCX, Taylor Swift, Sia, The Strokes, Smashing Pumpkins and more.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Releasing (or even conceiving) a project of such grandeur may seem self-indulgent, but A. G. Cook is not a mere mortal artist. For the past 7 years he\u2019s been the head of PC Music, perhaps one of the most unusual and forward-thinking electronic music labels in the world today. You absolutely must <a href="https://pcmusic.bandcamp.com/">check them out</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Apart from being quite busy with the label, A. G. Cook is probably most-well know as an executive producer of the last several Charli XCX albums. He also made an appearance in her stunning, self-directed <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPRy1B4t5YA">\u201cBoys\u201d music video</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-full post-content-image" id="yui_3_17_2_1_1705002569313_76"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="720" height="720" src="http://localhost:8888/wordpress-trunk/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/a.g.cook-paradigm-talent-agency.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-176" srcset="https://qfn.fuu.mybluehost.me/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/a.g.cook-paradigm-talent-agency.jpg 720w, https://qfn.fuu.mybluehost.me/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/a.g.cook-paradigm-talent-agency-300x300.jpg 300w, https://qfn.fuu.mybluehost.me/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/a.g.cook-paradigm-talent-agency-150x150.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><em>Cillian Murphy, anyone? \u00a9Paradigm Talent Agency</em></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Cook\u2019s main influences (that drip into the output of the whole label) lie in various incarnations of bubblegum music with a certain degree of abrasiveness: 90s europop, hardcore and happy hardcore, nightcore and bubblegum pop itself. But 7G is far more than just that. \u201cA-Z\u201d is a high octane jungle-infused take, \u201cBeetlebum\u201d is a perfect mix of guitar-based indie with dirrrrrty beats, \u201cNote Velocity\u201d could\u2019ve been written by a mid-20th century experimental composer and \u201cNo Yeah\u201d is ASMR af.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201c7G\u201d can be viewed as a window into Cook\u2019s mind. Some of the riffs have been used in other tracks, some tracks sound more like sketches rather than finished songs and some feel like lab experiments. But there is nothing half-baked about the music. A. G. Cook\u2019s dedication and meticulousness are just uncanny. After all, he made a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwH1sFJYzPA">note-by-note cover of \u201cWindowlicker\u201d</a>, who the fuck even does that?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He can really do anything, which is being showcased in full here. Guitar songs? Check. Abstract soundscapes? Check. Sugary soda-water-cotton-candy-bubblegum electronica? Big check. Outright bizarre stuff? Check.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Covers deserve an honorable mention here. While the covers seem to get some shit online they are far from being bad or lazy. It just seems that when tackling anthemic classics like \u201cBeetlebum\u201d, \u201cToday\u201d or \u201cChandelier\u201d you can never win. And let\u2019s be honest, Cook\u2019s take on these timeless songs is not particularly what you\u2019d expect.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you could only choose one album to exemplify what electronic music is in 2020, \u201c7G\u201d should certainly go to the desert island with you.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-spotify wp-block-embed-spotify wp-embed-aspect-21-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">\n<iframe title="Spotify Embed: 7G" style="border-radius: 12px" width="100%" height="352" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen allow="autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture" loading="lazy" src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/album/0PHVIdlkceOpjYgvUER4Nd?go=1&#038;sp_cid=4ee5ae78b0fe5b2a952220851425f3a8&#038;utm_source=oembed&#038;utm_medium=desktop"></iframe>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<iframe allow="autoplay *; encrypted-media *; fullscreen *; clipboard-write" frameborder="0" height="450" style="width:100%;max-width:660px;overflow:hidden;border-radius:10px;" sandbox="allow-forms allow-popups allow-same-origin allow-scripts allow-storage-access-by-user-activation allow-top-navigation-by-user-activation" src="https://embed.music.apple.com/us/album/7g/1544377328"></iframe>\n',

        '\n<p>Uganda wouldn\u2019t be the first choice for most people when asked about the largest hubs of electronic music. Historically, there have been a handful of cities responsible for the development of the majority of electronic music genres. When we think electronic music, we usually think New York, London, Chicago, Detroit, Berlin. Dance music have been a refuge during the times of political and social turmoil and all those cities have been a hotspot of such activity for decades. But a handful of cities cannot remain the driving force in everything forever.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Enter Nyege Nyege Tapes: one of the most unusual electronic music labels in the world today. Based in Kampala, Uganda, their mission is \u201cexploring, producing and releasing outsider music from around the region\u201d. And their output is refreshingly different from anything you\u2019ve heard before. The songs are infused with polyrhythms, traditional music, wedding songs and tempos going all the way (to 11) to 200 bpm.</p>\n\n\n\n<iframe style="border: 0; width: 100%; height: 120px;" src="https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=3529194593/size=large/bgcol=333333/linkcol=0f91ff/tracklist=false/artwork=small/track=3126900871/transparent=true/" seamless><a href="https://nyegenyegetapes.bandcamp.com/album/poaa">Poaa by Bamba Pana</a></iframe>\n\n\n\n<p>Nyege Nyege was founded back in 2013 by two dudes: Arlen Dilsizian and Derek Debru. Debru was born in Burundi but grew up in Belgium. He moved to Uganda in 2010 to teach at the Kampala Film School. Dilsizian also moved to Kampala in 2010 (what a coincidence!). In 2013 they started a party named Boutiq Electronique. While most local parties were focusing on dancehall, hip hop and reggae, Boutiq Electronique showcased African genres such as <em>kuduro</em> and <em>coup\u00e9-d\u00e9cal\u00e9</em>. As the party\u2019s audience grew, the two started an artist residency and a studio focused on developing local talent.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<iframe style="border: 0; width: 100%; height: 120px;" src="https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=3065842028/size=large/bgcol=333333/linkcol=fe7eaf/tracklist=false/artwork=small/track=256398541/transparent=true/" seamless><a href="https://nyegenyegetapes.bandcamp.com/album/boutiq-electroniq">Boutiq Electroniq by Disco Vumbi</a></iframe>\n\n\n\n<p>As the popularity of their output grew even further, Debra and Dilsizian started Nyege Nyege Festival in 2015. It\u2019s been called \u201cthe world\u2019s best electronic music festival\u201d by <a href="https://www.factmag.com/2020/07/08/nyege-nyege-fest-2020/">FACT magazine.</a> In 2019 it was attended by about 12,000 ppl. Literally, hundreds of artists from across five continents performed for four days at the banks of Nile.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large post-content-image" id="yui_3_17_2_1_1704999099979_108"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="691" src="http://localhost:8888/wordpress-trunk/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/nyege-nyege-music-festival-the-vinyl-factory-1024x691.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-169" srcset="https://qfn.fuu.mybluehost.me/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/nyege-nyege-music-festival-the-vinyl-factory-1024x691.jpg 1024w, https://qfn.fuu.mybluehost.me/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/nyege-nyege-music-festival-the-vinyl-factory-300x203.jpg 300w, https://qfn.fuu.mybluehost.me/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/nyege-nyege-music-festival-the-vinyl-factory-768x518.jpg 768w, https://qfn.fuu.mybluehost.me/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/nyege-nyege-music-festival-the-vinyl-factory-1536x1037.jpg 1536w, https://qfn.fuu.mybluehost.me/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/nyege-nyege-music-festival-the-vinyl-factory.jpg 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><em>How awesome is that?! \u00a9The Vinyl Factory</em></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The 2019 Red Bull Music Festival in NYC featured a night dedicated to Nyege Nyege. Although two Nyege Nyege artists set to perform, MCZO and Duke, were denied entry into the U.S (ACAB).&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When it comes to their roster, Nyege Nyege is unusually diverse. We already <a href="https://oddboll.net/home/duma-duma">wrote about the extreme metal/extreme electronic duo Duma</a>, whose music blends grindcore vocals with harsh abrasive and noisy synths. There\u2019s also <a href="https://nyegenyegetapes.bandcamp.com/album/nihiloxica">Nihiloxica</a>, a 9-piece percussion group who blend live polyrhythms with icy and dirty synthesizer leads and bass.</p>\n\n\n\n<iframe style="border: 0; width: 100%; height: 120px;" src="https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=903853301/size=large/bgcol=333333/linkcol=e32c14/tracklist=false/artwork=small/track=2999686133/transparent=true/" seamless><a href="https://nyegenyegetapes.bandcamp.com/album/biiri">Biiri by Nihiloxica</a></iframe>\n\n\n\n<p>Nyege Nyege\u2019s scope goes well beyond the region. Their compilation <a href="https://nyegenyegetapes.bandcamp.com/album/sounds-of-sisso">\u201cSounds Of Sisso\u201d</a> highlights Tanzanian singeli music. Singeli is pop music in Tanzania but \u201cSounds Of Sisso\u201d focuses on a more underground side of this phenomenon with extremely fast tempos and dusty production.</p>\n\n\n\n<iframe style="border: 0; width: 100%; height: 120px;" src="https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=1483155390/size=large/bgcol=333333/linkcol=4ec5ec/tracklist=false/artwork=small/track=1042097228/transparent=true/" seamless><a href="https://nyegenyegetapes.bandcamp.com/album/sounds-of-sisso">Sounds of Sisso by Csso</a></iframe>\n\n\n\n<p>It is also worth mentioning that Nyege Nyege and Nyege Nyege Festival feature a great number of female identifying artists. <strong>MC Yallah</strong> is a badass rapper who actually had a show called <em>Newzbeat </em>where she rapped the news (cooooool). Her main musical focus is grime but she doesn\u2019t shy away from pretty much anything.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio embed-youtube"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">\n<iframe loading="lazy" title="MC Yallah x Debmaster - Dunia" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Z-pgvBJlWx4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Blakrok</strong> might be a familiar name to those who watched Marvel\u2019s Black Panther. She is featured on a b-b-banger \u201cOpps\u201d with Vince Staples and Kendrick Lamar. She says when she performs, it makes her feel powerful, because <a href="https://www.dazeddigital.com/music/article/46153/1/nyege-nyege-festival-2019-female-mcs-rappers-list">\u201cspeaking words of power and getting the right energy out of an audience is a spiritual thing\u201d</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio embed-youtube"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">\n<iframe loading="lazy" title="Yugen Blakrok - House of Ravens [Music Video]" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/NHkBxjbXEAY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>On a more frenetic side of the spectrum is <strong>MC Anti Virus</strong> whose set at Nyege Nyege Festival 2019 was a lesson in Tanzania\u2019s singeli music (which some call African gabber). The set is an absolutely uncanny swarm of energy and we dare those of you who like dancing all night to keep up with its tempo for the whole set.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio embed-youtube"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">\n<iframe loading="lazy" title="Reedah &amp; Anti Varius | Nyege Nyege Festival: Day 1" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/PEixsVjvUhY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Another two stellar MCs from the singeli scene are <strong>Kadilida</strong> and <strong>Rehema Tajiri</strong>.\u201cYou have to be very strong, and very good at freestyling\u201d Kadilida <a href="https://www.dazeddigital.com/music/article/46153/1/nyege-nyege-festival-2019-female-mcs-rappers-list">told Dazed</a> \u201cWhen I perform there are so many men and boys there. It makes me feel very strong, because a lot of them respect me, [\u2026] when I\u2019m MCing I feel different. I feel like I can do so many things\u201d.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio embed-youtube"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">\n<iframe loading="lazy" title="Kadilida - sONg mZuka prod.

At 49, she performed in Tanzania for decades before moving to singeli music. She admits her love to fast tempos and rapid changes of singeli music.&nbsp;\u201cI\u2019m inspired by female rappers from the USA like Queen Latifah. They\u2019ve done it, so why can\u2019t I?\u201d, she <a href="https://youtu.be/CP52WCwJYlo">admitted to Dazed</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio embed-youtube"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">\n<iframe loading="lazy" title="REHEMA TAJIRI - GOMA (OFFICIAL VIDEO)" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/CP52WCwJYlo?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2016 Debru and Dilsizian founded Nyege Nyege Tapes with the goal of releasing African, noncommercial artists. Some of the releases are actually field recordings of artists who were never recorded before. For the collectors out there: Nyege Nyege Tapes also issue their music on cassettes and vinyl but they sell out real fast. At the moment of writing every single cassette has been sold out and they are going for about $50 on Discogs (for a cassette!).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Without exaggeration: Nyege Nyege is a gift that keeps on giving. From amazing parties and a&nbsp;steady flow of uncanny releases to a festival that is a must for any dance music fan. Their <a href="https://nyegenyegetapes.bandcamp.com/">Bandcamp page</a> is a rabbit hole of electronic music like nothing else. From upbeat energy of singeli artists to abstract (ish) <a href="https://nyegenyegetapes.bandcamp.com/album/the-electro-maloya-experiments-of-jako-maron">blips and blops of Jako Maron</a> to filed recordings of <a href="https://nyegenyegetapes.bandcamp.com/album/ekuka">Ugandan griot Ekuka Morris Sirikiti</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We also made a very special playlist dedicated to Nyege Nyege Tapes!

        '\n<p>This is an album endorsed by Zappa, Moldy Peaches and Deerhoof. Kurt Cobain placed it at number 5 in his best albums of all time list. Critics love it, collectors drool over the idea of even seeing and original 1969 copy of this record. This one is the ultimate holy grail/lost gem/outside classic.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is kinda hard to grasp what exactly is so captivating about this record. Perhaps it\u2019s the perfect mix of teenage poetry, child-like level of musicianship and some otherworldly chemistry and interplay that flow through every single note played and sung.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Shaggs were conceived (quite literally, considering they were all sisters) by their father, Austin, who believed that his mother predicted their rise to stardom. And she did it during a palmreading, of course. Believe it or not, his other two predictions came true and one could argue that the this one did as well. So he did what any parent, who truly believes in their kids would do: withdrew them from school, bought them instruments and arranged for music and vocal lessons. The sisters themselves didn\u2019t really plan on becoming a band but just like any caring parent, Austin wouldn&#8217;t listen. Somehow he arranged for them to have regular gigs every Saturday in 1968 and the following year they recorded this masterpiece. In a day. No one believed in them and their father used almost all his savings to make this record. He used some semi-shady local label and after the original 1000 copies were pressed, 900 of them vanished. And then the label\u2019s president vanished. And then the label folded. Nevertheless, record collectors got ahold of the album and word of mouth quickly spread. Those who liked it, wouldn\u2019t shut up about it. But you\u2019ve probably guessed that a lot of people did not enjoy the music that much. The band members themselves reportedly hated the sound and couldn\u2019t get why years later this record became so popular.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-full post-content-image" id="yui_3_17_2_1_1704998851104_76"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="790" height="395" src="http://localhost:8888/wordpress-trunk/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/The-Shaggs.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-159" srcset="https://qfn.fuu.mybluehost.me/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/The-Shaggs.jpg 790w, https://qfn.fuu.mybluehost.me/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/The-Shaggs-300x150.jpg 300w, https://qfn.fuu.mybluehost.me/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/The-Shaggs-768x384.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 790px) 100vw, 790px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><em>Musical anarchists \u00a9 Pitchfork</em></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>But why did it anyway? The story goes that Frank Zappa was a guest on a radio show and was playing his favorite songs. Among them were a couple by The Shaggs.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In 1980, two members of NRBQ persuaded their label to reissue the album. The album was widely reviewed and Rolling Stone called it \u201cComeback of the Year\u201d. They were even called \u201cBetter Than The Beatles\u201d which kinda makes them better than Jesus, doesn\u2019t it?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There is an ongoing dispute whether the album sounds that avant-garde intentionally or The Shaggs just couldn\u2019t play any better. Their father claimed it was all 100% genuine, The Shaggs said there were some rhythm mistakes that were intentionally left in. Apparently nobody knows for sure. But does it really matter? If it was done intentionally, then this might be one of the most forward thinking and truly free sounding bands of all time, on par with Trout Mask Replica. If it was indeed the way they played then the record retains its charm and unbelievable mix of weirdness and innocence.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>No matter what people say about it, \u201cPhilosophy Of The World\u201d remains unmatched in its sheer uniqueness.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-spotify wp-block-embed-spotify wp-embed-aspect-21-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">\n<iframe title="Spotify Embed: Philosophy of the World" style="border-radius: 12px" width="100%" height="352" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen allow="autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture" loading="lazy" src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/album/0TzI1YcMAQVdQ4yUZuy7fA?go=1&#038;sp_cid=4ee5ae78b0fe5b2a952220851425f3a8&#038;utm_source=oembed&#038;utm_medium=desktop"></iframe>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<iframe allow="autoplay *; encrypted-media *; fullscreen *; clipboard-write" frameborder="0" height="450" style="width:100%;max-width:660px;overflow:hidden;border-radius:10px;" sandbox="allow-forms allow-popups allow-same-origin allow-scripts allow-storage-access-by-user-activation allow-top-navigation-by-user-activation" src="https://embed.music.apple.com/ca/album/philosophy-of-the-world/1086626079"></iframe>\n',

        '\n<p>You may consider this anti-music for pretentious snobs but this album\u2019s influence and legacy are absolutely undeniable. So who gives a fuck about haters?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It\u2019s hard to tell whether Don Van Vliet (aka Captain Beefheart) could have anticipated the impact this album was going to have. He had lots of ambition and he surely went full-on trying to fulfill his vision.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The first two albums established Captain Beefheart &amp; His Magic Band as an artist to watch but some of Van Vliet\u2019s more oddball ideas were rejected as too unconventional. He also was less musically able than some of his band members so he simply replaced them and began to resemble a dictator or a cult leader. That would\u2019ve been anybody\u2019s first choice too! After having issues with various record labels, the band signed to Frank Zappa\u2019s newly created Straight and were given full artistic freedom. Well at least Captain Beefheart himself was. Zappa was assigned as a producer, a task he would perform by stayng out of the way.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The most amazing aspect to this record is that it\u2019s actually not just a bunch of wannabes trying to make sounds with whatever they can find, but the band actually practiced all <em>this</em> for eight months living communally and then recreated it all in the studio.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Just as the music itself, Captain Beefheart\u2019s creative process was quite unconventional. In an attempt to establish himself as an unquestionable authority he did everything in his power to crush his bandmates\u2019 will by continually berating them and often using physical violence. While preparing for the recording, the band went to a remote house and practiced 12-14 hours a day often sleeping right in the practice room and immediately going back to rehearsing upon waking up. Beefheart put a piano in one of the rooms and used it to write songs despite not being able to play the instrument. The bits and pieces he wrote were later translated by the band\u2019s drummer, John French (or \u201cDrumbo\u201d as Beefheart named him). French described the creative process as being similar to trying to build a solid wall with bricks of different size.<br>Their financial situation was also poor. French remembered surviving on a can of soybeans a day for about a month. At one point they were even arrested for shoplifting food (insert starving artist joke here\u2026or don\u2019t). After several months of constant practice the band went into the studio and recorded the album in about 6 hours. Beefheart himself, despite being absent from a lot of rehearsals and not using headphones, easily synced with the instrumentals.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large post-content-image" id="yui_3_17_2_1_1704998324641_72"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="683" src="http://localhost:8888/wordpress-trunk/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/captain-beefheart-trout-mask-replica-1024x683.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-155" srcset="https://qfn.fuu.mybluehost.me/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/captain-beefheart-trout-mask-replica-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://qfn.fuu.mybluehost.me/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/captain-beefheart-trout-mask-replica-300x200.jpg 300w, https://qfn.fuu.mybluehost.me/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/captain-beefheart-trout-mask-replica-768x512.jpg 768w, https://qfn.fuu.mybluehost.me/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/captain-beefheart-trout-mask-replica-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://qfn.fuu.mybluehost.me/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/captain-beefheart-trout-mask-replica-2048x1365.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><em>Gang \u00a9Rolling Stone</em></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the major influences on album\u2019s composition was Beefheart\u2019s friend, Gary Marker. He was learning to splice tape and combining pieces of different compositions. And that\u2019s really how the album sounds at first \u2014 like recordings of a maniac who chopped up his entire record collection and put it together with their feet. While on acid. The instruments don\u2019t follow any linear paths. They exist in different time signatures, keys, time zones and continents. And yet somehow they hold together without ever spiraling into pointless chaos. The lyrics go in line with the composition and are super fragmented pieces of consciousness put together in a particular order just because.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The album\u2019s influence is absolutely uncanny and some of the most forward-thinking creatives of their time listed it as a major influence. Matt Groening called it \u201cthe greatest album he\u2019d ever heard\u201d (even though it took him 7 listens to fully understand it), David Lynch called it the greatest album of all time, John Lydon (John who?) said that after listening to it \u201cthere was room for everything\u201d and John Frusciante mentioned that \u201cif he listens to it first thing in the morning, he\u2019s assured of a day of unbridled creativity\u201d and named Zoot Horn Rollo\u2019s guitar playing as his most important inspiration.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This record is an astonishing <em>group</em> effort despite being dictated by Captain Beefheart. Without arrangements, incredible guitar work and amazing instrumentation throughout, Trout Mask Replica would have never been this huge. A work of art created out of unlikely circumstances and through questionable routines.<br>Was it all worth the effort? The members of the Magic Band hung around the music industry for a while but none of them achieved anything truly remarkable despite being quite able musicians (could <em>you </em>work out something like this). Captain Beefheart\u2019s own name is forever cemented in music history through lots of different projects but this is his magnum opus.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Love it or hate it, Trout Mask Replica is a work of art that continues to exist outside of time and it will never be matched in it\u2019s weirdness and as an expression of absolute creative freedom.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio embed-youtube"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">\n<iframe loading="lazy" title="Captain Beefheart &amp; His Magic Band - Trout Mask Replica [Full Album]" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/aF0g-2SeoMM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</div></figure>\n',

        '\n<p>When it comes to oddball cinema, Jim Jarmusch is indeed one of the undisputed masters. So how exciting is that he\u2019s also making music? Unlike many people who are successful in one field and try something else as a way of developing their \u201chobbies\u201d, SQ\u00dcRL would\u2019ve been a highly enjoyable act even without Jarmusch\u2019s other accolades.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Influenced by all the cool stuff such as psychedelia, noise, chopped &amp; screwed hip hop, tape loops, sad country, drone and all that feedback-laden stoner stuff the band put out this series of EPs in 2013-2014. Well, technically their first work was soundtrack to The Limits of Control, but that was under the name Bad Rabbit.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The first EP is an uninspiringly titled EP1. It starts off with a very soundtracky take \u201cPink Dust\u201d. Repetitive, drowned in guitar feedback and big heavy spaced-out drums that create a stoner background to a loop of a lady talking about&#8230;ehm&#8230;something with a thick French accent.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cPinks Dust\u201d is followed by two tracks with actual singing by Jim Jarmusch himself. One of them being a cover of Elvis\u2019 \u201cLittle Sister\u201d (whaaaa???&#8230;)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The last track on EP1 is a bunch of glorious feedback aptly titled \u201cFeedback for Jozef Van Wissem\u201d.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large post-content-image" id="yui_3_17_2_1_1704998096335_67"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="683" src="http://localhost:8888/wordpress-trunk/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/squrl-1024x683.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-147" srcset="https://qfn.fuu.mybluehost.me/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/squrl-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://qfn.fuu.mybluehost.me/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/squrl-300x200.jpg 300w, https://qfn.fuu.mybluehost.me/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/squrl-768x512.jpg 768w, https://qfn.fuu.mybluehost.me/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/squrl-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://qfn.fuu.mybluehost.me/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/squrl-2048x1365.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><em><s>Will Forte</s> Carter Logan &amp; Jim Jarmusch \u00a9The Rolling Stone</em></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>EP2 (see the pattern here?) starts off similarly to EP1 with a recording of somebody\u2019s voice on top of drony guitar feedback, warm analog crackling and probably the fastest drum breaks in the whole series.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Musically, it follows in the footsteps of EP1 and ends with a tasty remix of \u201cPink Dust\u201d by the mighty Nick Zinner of Yeah Yeah Yeahs.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The final installment in the series, EP3 continues developing on the familiar sound of the previous two. Same overdriven to the brim guitar producing unholy feedback, dark, muddy arpeggios and distant vocal singing about dead hippies (actual lyrics from EP1) or whatever else comes into their oddball minds.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>EP3 ends with a slow (but what isn\u2019t slow with SQ\u00dcRL) acoustic guitar-based song \u201cShould I Go or Should I Stay\u201d which leaves us wondering how much of a Clash pastiche is this title?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you\u2019re a fan of everything dirty, crunchy and weird you\u2019ll fall in love with SQ\u00dcRL from the very first listen. The best thing about this outfit is that they continue to deliver with their latest album \u201cSome Music for Robby M\u00fcller\u201d being an outstanding sign that SQ\u00dcRL are a fully accomplished band with a lot to offer.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>All three EPs have also seen an amazing (but soooo limited) vinyl release on picture discs with prices clocking in at almost $100 these days.</p>\n',

        '\n<p>Yes, Kate Bush is by no means an obscure artist. But it doesn\u2019t make her less weird and The Dreaming any less unconventional and exciting. She was dismantling pop music and putting the pieces together the way she saw fit. This album is unmistakably pop but put together through experimental and avant-garde.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Legend has it that Bush arrived to EMI with a collection of songs from which her first four albums were made up. \u201cThe Dreaming\u201d was her first effort of newly written material. Having worked with a producer before, Bush decided to produce this album herself. Armed with a relatively new and unexplored Fairlight CMI synth and a Lynn drum machine Bush set out to create something completely from scratch. Coupled with idiosyncratic songwriting and absolutely insane vocal work the music creates a rich experience and sensory overload. A plethora of folk instruments, shifting time signatures, synthesizer textures, vocal loops and polyrhythms are all a bold statement of an artist brave enough to go beyond the conventional. She creates rich soundscapes practically unheard of in 80s pop.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-full post-content-image" id="yui_3_17_2_1_1704997855770_76"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="749" height="743" src="http://localhost:8888/wordpress-trunk/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Kate-Bush.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-140" srcset="https://qfn.fuu.mybluehost.me/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Kate-Bush.jpg 749w, https://qfn.fuu.mybluehost.me/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Kate-Bush-300x298.jpg 300w, https://qfn.fuu.mybluehost.me/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Kate-Bush-150x150.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 749px) 100vw, 749px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><em>Kate Bush and a bush (hahaha, hee hee hee, haw haw haw) \u00a9The Internet</em></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Her vocals alone would be a work of art even without the palette of musical background they enjoy here. Bush comes up a plethora of vocal sounds and techniques pushing the boundaries of what a pop vocalist is allowed to do.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The lyrics draw on a vast number of influences from old crime films and the Vietnam war to the plight of Indigenous Australians and life and death of Harry Houdini.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Upon its release the album quickly became a fan favorite but was considered a commercial failure for an artist her size. It was truly appreciated only years later. Almost four decades after it was released its landmark status is still standing strong. Bjork and Big Boi name this album among their favorites. Kate Bush herself called \u201cThe Dreaming\u201d her \u201cmad\u201d album. Even though \u201cThe Dreaming\u201d was overwhelmingly called \u201cuncommercial\u201d it went straight to #3 in UK chart. This fact was mocked by Bush herself who stated in an interview that it seemed ironic to her that the album everyone called \u201cuncommercial\u201d performed that well in the charts.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The album is a work of an artist finally getting to know herself and setting herself free from the boundaries of pop music. Kate Bush went on to become a true legend who sustained a long and successful carrier but this album is where the genius was being born and it makes the listening even more exciting.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-spotify wp-block-embed-spotify wp-embed-aspect-21-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">\n<iframe title="Spotify Embed: The Dreaming (2018 Remaster)" style="border-radius: 12px" width="100%" height="352" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen allow="autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture" loading="lazy" src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/album/59dmyw7CgPluQ6PlTmn7ik?go=1&#038;sp_cid=4ee5ae78b0fe5b2a952220851425f3a8&#038;utm_source=oembed&#038;utm_medium=desktop"></iframe>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<iframe allow="autoplay *; encrypted-media *; fullscreen *; clipboard-write" frameborder="0" height="450" style="width:100%;max-width:660px;overflow:hidden;border-radius:10px;" sandbox="allow-forms allow-popups allow-same-origin allow-scripts allow-storage-access-by-user-activation allow-top-navigation-by-user-activation" src="https://embed.music.apple.com/us/album/the-dreaming/1675374915"></iframe>\n',

        '\n<p>Nick Cave has always been an oddball. His signature blend of no wave, gothic, blues and pop is not something a lot of artists can pull off. With a career spanning god knows how many decades, his catalogue jumps through so many genres it\u2019s easier to just tag it as \u201cNick Cave\u201d.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Grinderman is not particularly a hidden gem being Nick Cave\u2019s project but it feels a bit overlooked compared to his other work with The Birthday Party or The Bad Seeds.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Nick Cave started writing songs for this project on guitar, the instrument he could barely play and it certainly added to the primal nature of the sound. The music is gritty and dirty but retains it\u2019s pop sensibility which is sort of a tag line for lots of his songs. &nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-full post-content-image" id="yui_3_17_2_1_1704997716726_76"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="300" height="300" src="http://localhost:8888/wordpress-trunk/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/grinderman.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-136" srcset="https://qfn.fuu.mybluehost.me/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/grinderman.jpg 300w, https://qfn.fuu.mybluehost.me/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/grinderman-150x150.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><em>Dat mustache tho \u00a9The Quietus</em></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The album starts with an amphetamine of a song \u201cGet It On\u201d and the speed never really goes away.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cNo Pussy Blues\u201d is an absolutely hilarious lament to the days of bygone good looks and being hard but not getting laid. As mentioned by Pitchfork, \u201cNo Pussy Blues\u201d only gets funnier as you age. Will check back in a few decades.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201c(I Don\u2019t Need You To) Set Me Free)\u201d is slow bluesy garage rock, \u201cHoney Bee (Let\u2019s Fly To Mars)\u201d feels like it was written on speed and actually features Nick Cave doing the \u201cbzzz\u201d sound with lots of attitude and \u201cGo Tell The Women\u201d is either mocking or glorifying misogyny (although Cave\u2019s own words indicate he meant the first).&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It\u2019s impossible to pick highlights on this record, every song is a highlight.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Raw, dirty, primal but at the same time smart and melodic, this is a truly omnivorous record.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-spotify wp-block-embed-spotify wp-embed-aspect-21-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">\n<iframe title="Spotify Embed: Grinderman" style="border-radius: 12px" width="100%" height="352" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen allow="autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture" loading="lazy" src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/album/7H8mwwZrY0wptuWiIln2pp?go=1&#038;sp_cid=4ee5ae78b0fe5b2a952220851425f3a8&#038;utm_source=oembed&#038;utm_medium=desktop"></iframe>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<iframe allow="autoplay *; encrypted-media *; fullscreen *; clipboard-write" frameborder="0" height="450" style="width:100%;max-width:660px;overflow:hidden;border-radius:10px;" sandbox="allow-forms allow-popups allow-same-origin allow-scripts allow-storage-access-by-user-activation allow-top-navigation-by-user-activation" src="https://embed.music.apple.com/us/album/grinderman/1710206295"></iframe>\n',

        '\n<p>It\u2019s kinda unfair and hard to believe that this record is relatively unknown. But then if it were super popular, would its appeal change?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>From the first line of \u201cDrug Song\u201d Dave Bixby paints a vivid picture of a world of a leftover 60s hippie. Released in 1969, just as the whole movement was dissolving in the ecstatic agony of Woodstock and, subsequently the 70s, the album sounds deeply rooted in its era but also helplessly outside of time. \u201cOde to Quetzalcoatl\u201d could\u2019ve been released during the folk revival of the 90s and 00s as well as any decade prior.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-full post-content-image" id="yui_3_17_2_1_1704997493786_76"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="600" height="899" src="http://localhost:8888/wordpress-trunk/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/dave-bixby.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-130" srcset="https://qfn.fuu.mybluehost.me/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/dave-bixby.jpg 600w, https://qfn.fuu.mybluehost.me/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/dave-bixby-200x300.jpg 200w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><em>Dave Bixby around that time \u00a9discogs.com</em></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The lyrics perfectly capture the \u201clost\u201d quality of the album. It\u2019s a tired lament to the wild, drug-induced years of the decade. But at the same time, Bixby sings about finding God and being reborn and drug free. At least in his songs, he sounds as if he managed to escape the disappointment that prevailed after the hippie upheaval went to nothing.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Around the time of the album\u2019s writing, Bixby got involved with Don DeGraaf\u2019s \u201cThe Movement\u201d which was a religious cult (could this album get more 60s?). It seems to have it all: drugs, rehabilitation, redemption, newfound spirituality all in a packaging of a damaged loner quietly strumming his guitar in front of a long lost microphone in an empty room.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The album itself was a private press, made without a label to distribute between a limited number of people (original vinyl, if you\u2019re lucky to find it, will cost you about US$1200). By pure and random twist of fate this album got resurfaced during the Internet age and was praised by nearly every community that knew of its existence. In 2009 the album was reissued by Spanish label Guerssen Records. Bixby himself, reportedly got offers to play shows all over the world.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What adds to the whole mythical demeanor of this album is that the artist himself seems to be detached from it these days. During his interview with WIDR Bixby admitted that he had to relearn how to play the songs and that he also feels that they were written by a different person.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The album sounds incredibly wholesome and it is hard to describe the vast imagery it evokes with it\u2019s every stroke. If you\u2019re looking for some psychedelic melancholic loner folk \u2014 it\u2019s a perfect record for you.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-spotify wp-block-embed-spotify wp-embed-aspect-21-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">\n<iframe title="Spotify Embed: Ode To Quetzalcoatl" style="border-radius: 12px" width="100%" height="352" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen allow="autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture" loading="lazy" src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/album/3Ef0ldO7S2t3cu7xVSWCSW?go=1&#038;sp_cid=4ee5ae78b0fe5b2a952220851425f3a8&#038;utm_source=oembed&#038;utm_medium=desktop"></iframe>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<iframe allow="autoplay *; encrypted-media *; fullscreen *; clipboard-write" frameborder="0" height="450" style="width:100%;max-width:660px;overflow:hidden;border-radius:10px;" sandbox="allow-forms allow-popups allow-same-origin allow-scripts allow-storage-access-by-user-activation allow-top-navigation-by-user-activation" src="https://embed.music.apple.com/us/album/ode-to-quetzalcoatl/1707413053"></iframe>\n',

        '\n<p>In the recent years, Nyege Nyege established themselves as one of the most unusual music labels. Based in Kampala, Uganda, they specialize in weird experimental outsider music from the region and beyond. The stuff they put out is absolutely incredible and soooo fucked.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Their most recent release is the Kenyan metal band Duma. To be honest, it\u2019s not really fair to categorize Duma as \u201cmetal\u201d. Their music is mostly electronic-based even though it shares many traits with metal (like vocals). It\u2019s also heavy af. Not as in distorted guitars and thunderous drums but as in it\u2019s a heavy listen. The composition is absolutely insane. You\u2019ll be struggling to pinpoint any linear logic as songs fade in and out, drown in noise and drop into unimaginable chaos. All that at breakneck tempos and with drum machine parts that sound more like a war zone than actual drumming. Duma don\u2019t show any restraint when it comes to making dark and chaotic music. It mixes together industrial, drone, grindcore, power electronics and hand drumming. On top of all that is arguably one of the most versatile vocal performances in metal going from growling and screaming to the kind of whisper that will send shivers down your spine even on a bright and sunny day.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-full post-content-image" id="yui_3_17_2_1_1704997087006_76"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="683" src="http://localhost:8888/wordpress-trunk/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Duma-psp-culture.com_.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-123" srcset="https://qfn.fuu.mybluehost.me/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Duma-psp-culture.com_.jpg 1024w, https://qfn.fuu.mybluehost.me/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Duma-psp-culture.com_-300x200.jpg 300w, https://qfn.fuu.mybluehost.me/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Duma-psp-culture.com_-768x512.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><em>#dragon \u00a9psp-culture.com</em></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The band consists of Martin Khanja and Sam Karugu, Nairobi-Based musicians who\u2019ve been involved in various bands and projects together before forming Duma. Most of them are quite extreme but it\u2019s definitely Duma that takes their art into uncharted territory. Having performed at Nyege Nyege festival in 2019 the band gained some cult following and their debut album was highly anticipated among experimental and underground music enthusiasts. Well, this work would satisfy even the most picky of music snobs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Oh, and \u201cduma\u201d means \u201cdarkness\u201d in Kikuyu.\u00a0</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-spotify wp-block-embed-spotify wp-embed-aspect-21-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">\n<iframe title="Spotify Embed: Duma" style="border-radius: 12px" width="100%" height="352" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen allow="autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture" loading="lazy" src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/album/1jEsVcciMGOYLx0gj1Y3oQ?go=1&#038;sp_cid=4ee5ae78b0fe5b2a952220851425f3a8&#038;utm_source=oembed&#038;utm_medium=desktop"></iframe>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<iframe allow="autoplay *; encrypted-media *; fullscreen *; clipboard-write" frameborder="0" height="450" style="width:100%;max-width:660px;overflow:hidden;border-radius:10px;" sandbox="allow-forms allow-popups allow-same-origin allow-scripts allow-storage-access-by-user-activation allow-top-navigation-by-user-activation" src="https://embed.music.apple.com/us/album/duma/1549142683"></iframe>\n',

        '\n<p><em>Back in 2013 my friend and I had an idea for a printed fanzine about punk/hardcore culture. About a year before that I stumbled upon Phantom of the Black Hills on a since defunct music blog. Without much hope I sent them an email and they emailed back! Our publication never materialized, I left my hometown and completely forgot about this interview up until now. Please, enjoy the interview and don\u2019t forget to leave comments. Also, make sure to check out our review of Phantom Of The Black Hills\u2019 debut album </em><a href="https://oddboll.net/home/phantom-of-the-black-hills-ghosts">\u201cGhosts\u201d</a> <em>here.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>To start with, tell me what POTBH is and where are its origins?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>It was just a desire to play a style of music that is new and different but still has strong influences in old country and roots music.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Three albums in four years \u2013 not bad. But do you think you are evolving with each album, or simply go down the well-trodden paths?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Same direction, different paths. With every record we have done a better job of integrating the banjos, mandolins and fiddle with the heavy guitars, as well as the over all production.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>You make use of western (correct me if I\u2019m wrong) outlaw image, is it just a show or are you hung up on this lifestyle?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Definitely, a big part of this is a tribute to the true outlaws of the Old West, the late 1800\u2019s.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Tell us about your influences and what you are listening to now.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Old country &amp; bluegrass, punk rock, dark roots, agro/industrial music. Bands are 16 Horsepower, Heathen Apostles, Jayke Orvis.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Are you trying to say something with your music, or are you just having fun? And what is your work all about? Do you have a definite concept?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>What we\u2019re saying is that people need to start thinking for themselves, not the bullshit the government and mainstream media (the same thing) are telling them to believe.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>My opinion: you are underrated. Yours?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thanks for the compliment but we feel highly rated by our fans, they are hardcore to the bone. As far as the mainstream press they are too busy chasing around douchebag celebrities to care about anything else.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Tell me the truth: have you ever stolen bluntly from other artists?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>No.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>What is your opinion on contemporary music? Do you think of yourself as a part of it?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>For the most part modern country music is lame of course, and we don\u2019t feel a part of that, but there are some good young bands out there.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>I haven\u2019t found any information about your live shows. Aren\u2019t you by chance a studio band only?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>We\u2019ve played, it\u2019s just harder to tour these days, we\u2019ll get out here one of these days.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>How do you see the future of Phantom of the Black Hills?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Putting out more music, probably some singles and EPs, making the videos are fun too.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>On your new record you have collaborated with I might say legendary persons: Chopper Franklin as a producer and Geza X. What was their influence on the record?&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>They were both a big part of ENEMY!, both in tracking and mixing and in over all influence.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>One of my favorite tracks is Reb from the album </strong><a href="https://oddboll.net/home/phantom-of-the-black-hills-ghosts">\u201cGhosts\u201d</a><strong>. Is it special in any way? If not, can you tell us about some special tracks?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>That is a great track, it was influenced by Irish chant songs. Men Call Me Mad is another great one from <a href="https://oddboll.net/home/phantom-of-the-black-hills-ghosts">Ghosts</a>.</p>\n',

        '\n<p>You don\u2019t and you shouldn\u2019t expect an album that was released on Brian Eno\u2019s Obscure label to be anything but weird. And this one was executively produced by Eno himself. Although commonly credited to Simon Jeffes, \u201cMusic From Penguin Cafe\u201d is actually a work of amazing and quite unusual group of musicians. It\u2019s impossible and pointless to try and put labels on this piece of music but if it helps, Jeffes himself called it his vision for a \u201cmodern semi-acoustic chamber group\u201d.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Recorded on a tight budget on the spot in 1974-76, the album is a masterpiece as a whole and each individual track is a gem. There is not a single note that can be considered a filler. It\u2019s all gorgeous, glorious, weird and artsy. It goes from nice and warm chamber pop that you might\u2019ve heard in an actual cafe (like the title track) to some experimental weirdness more suitable for the krautrock bands (like \u201cPigtail\u201d). It doesn\u2019t matter if you\u2019re looking for something nice for a dinner party with your grandparents or you just enjoyed a 10 inch joint and would like to get fucked in the head: you\u2019ll find it all here. The album provides an amazing span of emotions and probably one of the most suitable titles ever: &#8220;The Sound Of Someone You Love Who&#8217;s Going Away And It Doesn&#8217;t Matter\u201d. It\u2019s uncanny how that soft guitar arpeggio and emotive strings capture the feeling.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-full post-content-image" id="yui_3_17_2_1_1704995387696_76"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="526" height="296" src="http://localhost:8888/wordpress-trunk/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Penguin-Cafe-Orchestra.jpeg" alt="" class="wp-image-112" srcset="https://qfn.fuu.mybluehost.me/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Penguin-Cafe-Orchestra.jpeg 526w, https://qfn.fuu.mybluehost.me/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Penguin-Cafe-Orchestra-300x169.jpeg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 526px) 100vw, 526px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><em>No penguins, not in a cafe \u00af\\_(\u30c4)_/\u00af</em></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The musicians behind the record are worth mentioning too. Simon Jeffes, who was the creator of the project (and who did the string arrangement for Sid Vicious\u2019 \u201cMy Way\u201d, btw) was the central force and primary performer on this and all subsequent Penguin Cafe Orchestra releases. He also wrote \u201cStill Life At The Penguin Cafe\u201d, which is a ballet.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Helen Liebmann was a classically trained cellist who studied at the Royal Academy of Music (the one that\u2019s in London). She was also a music therapist (you can probably see that).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Steve Nye is a music producer who worked with XTC, Bryan Ferry, Japan and Frank Zappa.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Gavyn Wright is an accomplished violinist and arranger who worked with Elton John, Tina Turner, Van Morrison and Oasis. He also wrote a bunch of soundtracks including Shrek 1 and 2, Shakespeare in Love, The Last Emperor and 12 Monkeys.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And probably the most unexpected of them all is Emily Young who\u2019s actually a famous British sculptor and has even been called &#8220;Britain&#8217;s greatest living stone sculptor\u201d. Her grandma was a colleague of August Rodin. Young provided vocals for \u201cCoronation\u201d and \u201cvocals\u201d for \u201cMilk\u201d. She\u2019s also responsible for those chillin\u2019 penguins on the cover. She used to live with Jeffes and they have a son Arthur, who continues performing with the band, now called Penguin Cafe.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The group went on to release more great music, for their first live gig they supported Kraftwerk and ceased to exist after Jeffes\u2019 death in 1997. They had a couple of hits later on but it is their debut that deserves its place here for being the most unusual and the most rewarding.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-spotify wp-block-embed-spotify wp-embed-aspect-21-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">\n<iframe title="Spotify Embed: Music From The Penguin Cafe" style="border-radius: 12px" width="100%" height="352" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen allow="autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture" loading="lazy" src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/album/2mrujo5T64bQN2SvPWranQ?go=1&#038;sp_cid=4ee5ae78b0fe5b2a952220851425f3a8&#038;utm_source=oembed&#038;utm_medium=desktop"></iframe>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<iframe allow="autoplay *; encrypted-media *; fullscreen *; clipboard-write" frameborder="0" height="450" style="width:100%;max-width:660px;overflow:hidden;border-radius:10px;" sandbox="allow-forms allow-popups allow-same-origin allow-scripts allow-storage-access-by-user-activation allow-top-navigation-by-user-activation" src="https://embed.music.apple.com/ca/album/music-from-the-penguin-cafe/714974408"></iframe>\n',

        '\n<p>The beauty of psychedelic music is that it drew upon so many influences from all over the world it actually spawned regional scenes in the most unexpected places (if you\u2019ve never listened to Iranian psychedelia you absolutely should).&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the most prominent scenes however, was on the rise in Brazil, dubbed \u201cTropicalia\u201d. The mix is absolutely perfect: percussion heavy, steamy rock with psychedelic experimentation of extremely potent artists. Every single name that was associated with Tropicalia had released highly influential (and outright incredible) albums: Caetano Veloso, Tom Z\u00e9, Jorge Ben, Gilberto Gil, Gal Costa and more.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It was an unstable and tumultuous time for Brazil when political movements swung from far-left to far-right within less then a decade. The musicians of the era embraced the zeitgeist and consumed the influences from within their own culture as well as the outside world.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Unfortunately, as it usually goes with stories involving political turmoil and the military, it all ended up with Veloso and Gil being detained for two months and then ultimately exiled. The whole Tropicalia movement was too weird for the government to pass on so arrests and censorship became commonplace. It\u2019s a complicated topic so feel free too look it up on Wikipedia, it\u2019ll be worth your while.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-full post-content-image" id="yui_3_17_2_1_1704994341889_76"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="281" height="400" src="http://localhost:8888/wordpress-trunk/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Gal-Costa.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-106" srcset="https://qfn.fuu.mybluehost.me/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Gal-Costa.jpg 281w, https://qfn.fuu.mybluehost.me/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Gal-Costa-211x300.jpg 211w" sizes="(max-width: 281px) 100vw, 281px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><em>How cool is that? \u00a9listal.com</em></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Meanwhile, we\u2019ll focus on one of the most unusual and compelling documents of the era.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cGal\u201d was far from Costa\u2019s debut. Not only she released another gem, \u201cGal Costa\u201d just a few months prior, she was already an established singer nationwide with more than one big hit behind her belt and frequent collaborations with aforementioned avant-garde of the Tropicalia movement. Any of her albums from that period deserves an article but \u201cGal\u201d earned its place here for being arguably her weirdest effort.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Just looking at the cover alone one might foresee what\u2019s about to happen. Across only 9 tracks and about 35 minutes of music, Gal Costa reassembles psychedelia, Brazilian pop, bossa nova, Jimi Hendrix, Afro-jazz, fusion and whatever was possible/allowed for a singer to do. Every song is filled with her unstoppable creative force with the musicians playing catch up.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She screams, she wails and then she sings with her voice commanding the music at every turn. It\u2019s a frenetic trip through the world of rhythm and fuzziness.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You don\u2019t need to speak Portuguese to feel what the songs are about. It\u2019s all countercultural and 60s af.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Songwriting credits are basically who-is-who of Tropicalia and Brazilian popular music of the era: Caetano Veloso, Gilberto Gil, Jorge Ben, Roberto and Erasmo Carlos.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This record is a whirlwind of 60s psychedelic weirdness in a best possible sense.&nbsp;Pitchfork compared \u201cGal\u201d to <a href="https://pitchfork.com/features/from-the-pitchfork-review/9978-god-is-on-the-loose-how-the-tropicalia-movement-provided-hope-during-brazils-darkest-years/">Barbra Streisand recording with Boredoms</a>.

        '\n<p>Even by today\u2019s standards this album is pretty experimental and just plain weird. When Cromagnon set out to create the music of the future, they surely went full on.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The album opens with \u201cCaledonia\u201d. Some compare it to Einstuerzende Neubauten playing black metal which is actually pretty accurate.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It\u2019s hard to determine whether this album is really a foreshadower of so many things to come (industrial, no wave, noise, drone, you name it) or just a couple of dudes trying to take the 60s experimentalism to its extreme. Reading through scarce fragments of the band\u2019s own recollections of the recording it looks like it was a little bit of both.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The band\u2019s ultimate goal was to create the music of the future. They did it by deconstructing it to the primal elements of the past. The album is tribal to the point you are wondering whether an actual Cro-Magnon suddenly got access to the studio (sorry for the pun).&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-full post-content-image" id="yui_3_17_2_1_1704994136247_76"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="220" height="205" src="http://localhost:8888/wordpress-trunk/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Cromagnon_band.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-102"/><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><em>Cromagnon in 1969 (maybe) \u00a9Wikipedia</em></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The album made use of Phil Spector\u2019s Wall of Sound and the band members themselves invited random people from the street into the studio to contribute to the album.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cOrgasm\u201d retains certain level of musicality and cohesiveness without ever getting unlistenable. Being accomplished producers, band members decided to stay away from the pre-made boxes of pop music and they indeed don\u2019t come anywhere near them. The resulting tracks are all over the place musically which makes the listening utterly exciting. The first time you listen to the album, you feel like a child going on a trip: there is something new and unexpected with every track.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is noisy, repetitive, atonal, random and underground. It was the only album Cro-Magnon ever released but it is a raw and tribal expression of emotions at its best. It\u2019s an incredible gateway record if you\u2019re trying to go beneath the music\u2019s surface.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-spotify wp-block-embed-spotify wp-embed-aspect-21-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">\n<iframe title="Spotify Embed: Cave Rock" style="border-radius: 12px" width="100%" height="352" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen allow="autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture" loading="lazy" src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/album/60StK3mTvlqeHhTGr9LS6Z?si=AuorT3IuR06IXdFxTf-5UA&#038;utm_source=oembed"></iframe>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<iframe allow="autoplay *; encrypted-media *; fullscreen *; clipboard-write" frameborder="0" height="450" style="width:100%;max-width:660px;overflow:hidden;border-radius:10px;" sandbox="allow-forms allow-popups allow-same-origin allow-scripts allow-storage-access-by-user-activation allow-top-navigation-by-user-activation" src="https://embed.music.apple.com/ca/album/cave-rock/1033650386"></iframe>\n',

        '\n<p>Back in the day I was using <a href="http://last.fm/"><em>last.fm</em></a> for music discovery almost exclusively. One of the things I would do is to look through my \u201cneighbors\u201d (<a href="http://last.fm/"><em>last.fm</em></a> feature to find people with similar tastes to yours), find someone we have the least compatibility and then search for artists I\u2019ve never encountered before. As I was finding profiles full of pretty obscure music I kept on seeing the same photo: four figures in huge eyeball masks in front of the Golden Gate bridge. First I was fascinated by the photo itself. There was something absolutely alien about it. The figures in the photo looked like someone from another planet was pretending to be normal. It was kind of cartoonish too. I\u2019ve started my acquaintance with their music with \u201cCommercial Album\u201d (bc of the title, obviously). But \u201cNot Available\u201d is their true masterpiece.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large post-content-image" id="yui_3_17_2_1_1704990213972_76"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="814" src="http://localhost:8888/wordpress-trunk/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/The-Residents-1024x814.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-98" srcset="https://qfn.fuu.mybluehost.me/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/The-Residents-1024x814.jpg 1024w, https://qfn.fuu.mybluehost.me/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/The-Residents-300x238.jpg 300w, https://qfn.fuu.mybluehost.me/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/The-Residents-768x611.jpg 768w, https://qfn.fuu.mybluehost.me/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/The-Residents-1536x1221.jpg 1536w, https://qfn.fuu.mybluehost.me/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/The-Residents.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><em>When you see it \u00a9The New York Times</em></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The album was recorder in 1974. However, based on the theory of obscurity it was immediately locked away in a vault until the band members have completely forgotten about its existence.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>N. Senada\u2019s theory if obscurity states that an artist can only produce pure art when the expectations and influences of the outside world are not taken into consideration. The album\u2019s liner notes also mentioned that the band were not planning on issuing this album at all since it was merely an exercise in group therapy. \u201cNot Available\u201d was finally released in 1978.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This record is more musical and coherent than most of the stuff The Residents produced throughout the 70s. Given how destructive their music was when they started out, the album could be almost considered \u201cpop\u201d by their standards. There are vocals and instruments and even some \u201cclassical\u201d orchestration. But The Residents take these elements, dismantle them and create something completely different distorting the whole core of musicality. It is amazing how a band of grown up people could retain such a child-like approach to music. They write every part, every line, every note just differently. The cryptic and experimental lyrics add to the sense of maliciousness, nervousness and anxiety. It\u2019s like a semi-bad trip that is unsettling but you kinda would like to see how it will unravel.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Is it impossible and unnecessary to compare this album to anything you\u2019ve ever heard. The music is unique and sometimes you struggle to believe that actual human beings came up with it (or did they?). \u201cNot Available\u201d sounds like a hallucinating alien or AI on drugs. It is an eye opening experience and it is a no brainer for anyone looking to approach music differently.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-spotify wp-block-embed-spotify wp-embed-aspect-21-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">\n<iframe title="Spotify Embed: Not Available" style="border-radius: 12px" width="100%" height="352" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen allow="autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture" loading="lazy" src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/album/01lk5qX0VaVEuuKe9mCSUB?si=K5Oe8eG_RLe_TEcn3PMvHQ&#038;utm_source=oembed"></iframe>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<iframe allow="autoplay *; encrypted-media *; fullscreen *; clipboard-write" frameborder="0" height="450" style="width:100%;max-width:660px;overflow:hidden;border-radius:10px;" sandbox="allow-forms allow-popups allow-same-origin allow-scripts allow-storage-access-by-user-activation allow-top-navigation-by-user-activation" src="https://embed.music.apple.com/us/album/not-available/411455769"></iframe>\n',

        '\n<p>Yo, fellas, whaddup? We\u2019re really excited to share this one with you! These dudes have everything you enjoy so much: dirty guitars, angry vocals, thumping drums, banjos, fiddles. \u201cWait, what?\u201d you may ask. We know, that fiddle at the very beginning might be misleading, but trust us, as soon as you\u2019ll hear that overdriven banjo you\u2019ll know \u2014 these dudes are for real. Owing just as much to barn dances as they do to Dead Kennedys, Phantom Of the Black Hills are a swarm of energy, attitude and fast-picked banjo notes. To confirm their punk roots: G\u00e9za X, the legendary West Coast producer actually produced the bands third album, Enemy!.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This may be only their debut record, but Phantom of the Black Hills are not searching for their sound: it\u2019s right here and ready to take you on a wild wild ride through the Wild Wild West were trains get robbed, bullets whistle at the ring of the church bell and whiskey substitutes water. Combining roots music with punk rock is nothing new and countless bands of varying quality have been doing it since the dawn of punk movement. But Phantom Of The Black Hills manage to pave a totally new path for themselves. Their influences and direction are clear and yet they can\u2019t be compared to any other \u201crootsy\u201d punk band.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-full post-content-image" id="yui_3_17_2_1_1704989085625_76"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="512" height="380" src="http://localhost:8888/wordpress-trunk/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Phantom-of-the-Black-Hills.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-93" srcset="https://qfn.fuu.mybluehost.me/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Phantom-of-the-Black-Hills.jpg 512w, https://qfn.fuu.mybluehost.me/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Phantom-of-the-Black-Hills-300x223.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 512px) 100vw, 512px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><em>They WILL rob your train \u00a9Gothic Americana</em></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cConfessions of a Barn Burner\u201d gives a pretty good idea of what is about to follow but every single track on the album is equally enjoyable which is pretty cool for the first record. The rest of the album is a collection of outstanding, high energy, fast picked songs sung with lots of attitude.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You may be a total hater of anything \u201chillbilly\u201d-related but Phantom of the Black Hills are one band you should check out.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Back in 2013 Nick somehow managed to interview these guys for a fanzine that never happened.

        '\n<p>Desire Marea is probably best known (at least was until now) as a part of gqom duo and DAZED100\u2019er FAKA (if you haven\u2019t checked them out yet, you absolutely <a href="http://www.siyakaka.com/">should</a>). They\u2019ve been figureheads of South African queer culture for a couple of years now and are absolutely stunning both <a href="https://soundcloud.com/faka-4">musically</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCyLcK_SXNC1RnYF18r308kg?feature=emb_ch_name_ex">visually</a>. Apart from that, FAKA also founded an inclusive club night Cunty Power and use it showcase the country\u2019s burgeoning LGBTQ+ scene.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cDesire\u201d is Desire Marea\u2019s first solo attempt.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The record takes in what FAKA are all about but explores it further while looking into different stylistic directions and sounds. Desire\u2019s operatic vocals go from falsetto to deep hum and sound incredibly beautiful sometimes reminding of ANOHNI.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Lyrically the album is a fascinating trip through various iterations of the meaning of \u201cdivine\u201d. Its lead single, \u201cYou Think I\u2019m Horny\u201d prioritizes love and intimacy over plain sex. Somewhere else, Marea extends a kind sort of divinity and spirituality to the dancefloor. Their lyrics are beautiful and empowering and when sung with that voice of theirs you just can\u2019t resist the goosebumps.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large post-content-image" id="yui_3_17_2_1_1704985550793_76"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="784" height="1024" src="http://localhost:8888/wordpress-trunk/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/desire-marea-784x1024.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-89" srcset="https://qfn.fuu.mybluehost.me/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/desire-marea-784x1024.jpg 784w, https://qfn.fuu.mybluehost.me/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/desire-marea-230x300.jpg 230w, https://qfn.fuu.mybluehost.me/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/desire-marea-768x1003.jpg 768w, https://qfn.fuu.mybluehost.me/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/desire-marea.jpg 960w" sizes="(max-width: 784px) 100vw, 784px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><em>\u00a9Bubblegum Club</em></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Musically, the album fits well with the trend in modern electronic music in that it you can\u2019t box it into any particular genre as it paves its own path. Atmospheric drones are followed by glitchy beats that are followed by more dance-oriented takes that are in turn followed by some unholy growls, hums, chimes, sawtooth waves and explosions. And yet somehow that swarm of sounds retains certain sense of tenderness and calm. It gently takes you and guides you towards the heavenly layer. But then \u201cStudies in Black Trauma\u201d starts off with some unexpectedly dark tone painting and you\u2019re not sure if it\u2019s actually heaven you were going to all along. But wherever Desire Marea wants to take us we\u2019re going for sure.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cDesire\u201d is a really strong contender to be in top 10 favs of 2020 and we\u2019re eagerly looking forward to what comes next from Desire Marea\u2019s brain.

        '\n<p>As far as experimental vocalists go, Shelley Hirsch\u2019s range of ideas, sounds she can produce with her voice alone and sheer weirdness of her creative output remain unmatched.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Born and raised in New York City, she dropped out of high school and moved to San Fransisco where she acted in the experimental Theatre of Man. Around this time she started exploring advanced vocal techniques and started composing pieces for voice.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After moving to Berlin, Hirsch had her first totally free improvised music concert. She also collaborated a lot with Jon Rose, another weirdo that deserves an article here.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She appeared on works by John Zorn, Elliott Sharp and Jim Stanley among others.&nbsp;Some of her works were released by John Zorn\u2019s label Tzadik.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-full post-content-image" id="yui_3_17_2_1_1704984840569_67"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="640" height="425" src="http://localhost:8888/wordpress-trunk/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Shelley-Hirsch.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-84" srcset="https://qfn.fuu.mybluehost.me/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Shelley-Hirsch.jpg 640w, https://qfn.fuu.mybluehost.me/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Shelley-Hirsch-300x199.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><em>The subject \u00a9flickr.com/fconcrete</em></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>It\u2019s not easy to find her work online (except for some collaborations) but it\u2019s an absolute must. Her voice is mesmerizing and it\u2019s absolutely uncanny what she can do with it.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It\u2019s a shame that her music is pretty much absent from the streaming services and even YouTube videos are scarce. But the few of them you can find are a rabbit hole of otherworldly sonic experiences. She would go from conventional and accessible singing, drawing from a wide range of influences to screaming, squealing and making some animal-related sounds within 5 min. This bootleg video from 20 years ago is absolutely stunning to watch. It\u2019s pointless to try and describe it so just watch <a href="https://youtu.be/39SR8og3YYo">here</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It\u2019s hard to believe that a human being can produce such sounds but what\u2019s more impressive is how can one come up with such stuff? Maybe somewhere aliens sing like that and consider this to be mainstream music, who knows?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio embed-youtube"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">\n<iframe loading="lazy" title="The Far In, Far Out Worlds of Shelley Hirsch" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/videoseries?list=OLAK5uy_kpVi9Y87XyrKPzv5UoN6VftM2t0dHlZjQ" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</div></figure>\n',

    content: {
      rendered:
        '\n<p>Unlike a huge chunk of contemporary electronic music (or pop music in general) Holly Herndon is not just a musician but an actual scientist. Born and raised in Tennessee and based in Berlin, Herndon studied composition at Stanford and completed her PhD at Stanford\u2019s Center for Computer Research in Music and Acoustics (wow). She also teaches, holds lectures performs workshops and builds her own instruments using Max/MSP.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For this album, Herndon created an AI program with her partner Mathew Dryhurst and programmer Jules LaPlace. They named the AI \u201cSpawn\u201d and together with contributing vocalists taught her to sing. Spawn, to which Herndon refers to as \u201cshe\u201d is considered to be an ensemble member rather than a mere program. The idea behind it was to try and make AI less dehumanizing (cooooool).&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image alignright post-content-image" id="yui_3_17_2_1_1700667854618_76"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="800" height="800" src="http://localhost:8888/wordpress-trunk/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/image.jpeg" alt="Her last name is also a tongue twister \u00a9BOMB Magazine" class="wp-image-78" srcset="https://qfn.fuu.mybluehost.me/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/image.jpeg 800w, https://qfn.fuu.mybluehost.me/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/image-300x300.jpeg 300w, https://qfn.fuu.mybluehost.me/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/image-150x150.jpeg 150w, https://qfn.fuu.mybluehost.me/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/image-768x768.jpeg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><em>Her last name is also a tongue twister \u00a9BOMB Magazine</em></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Fittingly enough, the album does sound really human. Like a computer-based person. Musically, it builds on centuries of vocal music drawing from such influences as Appalachian Sacred Harp Singing (\u201cFrontier\u201d) and Irish Chants. Quite remote from computers, isn\u2019t it? But it still retains characteristics of contemporary electronic music and was created almost entirely using computers.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While having an actual computer program as one of the musicians a lot of the album\u2019s sounds are actually human-based which somehow reassures that AI is still created by humans and we are connected and in control (for now). On the other hand it might give you chills as you realize that it is a <em>being</em> created by humans from nothing which is potentially far superior than we are.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some Bandcamp users said this album was close to a religious experience, a point that is indeed quite relatable.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>No matter what your personal stance on AI is, \u201cPROTO\u201d is not only curious from a scientific standpoint, it\u2019s an incredible and compelling listen on its own. Holly Herndon is a master of electronic music and a true innovator. Easily one the best electronic albums&nbsp; of 2019</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-spotify wp-block-embed-spotify wp-embed-aspect-21-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">\n<iframe title="Spotify Embed: PROTO" style="border-radius: 12px" width="100%" height="352" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen allow="autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture" loading="lazy" src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/album/3PkYFFSJTPxOhnSYBtyZsk?si=E0_AV_DJR7KTmT8UHlZFfg&#038;utm_source=oembed"></iframe>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<iframe allow="autoplay *; encrypted-media *;" frameborder="0" height="450" style="width:100%;overflow:hidden;background:transparent;" sandbox="allow-forms allow-popups allow-same-origin allow-scripts allow-storage-access-by-user-activation allow-top-navigation-by-user-activation" src="https://embed.music.apple.com/ca/album/proto/1454113472"></iframe>\n',
